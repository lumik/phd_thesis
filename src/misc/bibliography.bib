  abstract  = {Guanidiniocarbonyl pyrroles are artificial receptors for the efficient
complexation of carboxylates even in polar solvents such as water. Their
carboxylate binding site (CBS) exhibits an electronic absorption maximum at
similar to 298 nm and can be probed selectively by ultraviolet resonance
Raman (UV RR) scattering. We present a pH-dependent UV RR spectroscopic
investigation of two guanidiniocarbonyl pyrroles in water: the model receptor
CBS-NH2 and the peptide receptor CBS-Lys-Lys-Phe-NH2. UV RR spectra of 1 mM
aqueous solutions with 275 nm laser excitation were recorded between pH 6 and
7. Within this small pH range near the pK(a) of 6.4, protonated and neutral
CBS species are simultaneously present at similar concentrations (acid/base
equilibrium). Using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), the individual
UV RR component spectra of these distinct CBS species were determined without
any a priori knowledge. The pH-dependent UV RR spectra of the small model
receptor CBS-NH2 and the larger peptide receptor CBS-Lys-Lys-Phe-NH2 can both
be described as linear combinations of only two components. Control
experiments at pH 2 and pH 10 show an excellent agreement with the derived
NMF component spectra and confirm their assignment to the protonated and
neutral CBS species, respectively.},

  abstract  = {A new laser has been developed which generates hundreds of milliWatts
	of cw UV power below 260 nm. The laser consists of a small-frame
	Ar+-ion laser which is intracavity doubled with the use of BBO nonlinear
	optical crystals. More than 300 mW are available at 244 and 257 nm,
	while 180, 100, and 30 mW are available at 248, 238, and 228.9 nm,
	respectively. This laser is an ideal source for UV Raman spectroscopy
	since it avoids the nonlinear and saturation problems common with
	the typical pulsed laser excitation sources. It also minimizes thermal
	sample degradation. We demonstrate the increased spectral signal-to-noise
	ratios possible due to the ability to focus the cw laser into a small-volume
	element that can be efficiently imaged into the spectrometer. We
	demonstrate the ability of this laser to excite Raman spectra of
	solid samples such as coal-liquid residuals, and point out the utility
	of the 228.9-nm line for studying aromatic amino acids in proteins.
	We also demonstrate the ability to selectively study pyrene intercalated
	into calf thymus DNA.},

	as compared to a prominent protein tyrosine+tryptophan peak at 1616
	cm-1, on the other, have been attributed to very large variations
	in the RNA content of bacterial cells from culture to culture. The
	spectral changes are observed whenever differences in growth rates
	or variations in cultural media result in substantial changes in
	the amount of ribosomal RNA. In spite of very large cultural effects
	on peak intensities it has been possible to obtain bacterial G+C/A+T
	ratios from these spectra. Specifically, the ratio of the intensity
	of the C (1530 cm-1) peak to the intensity of the A+G peak (1485
	cm-1) when plotted against the known molar percent G+C of the corresponding
	bacterial DNA produces a straight line. Plots have been shown to
	be very nearly growth-time and media independent for fourteen different
	types of bacteria, which range in DNA G+C content from 32 to 66\%.
	Spectra obtained with 222.65-nm light, in contrast with spectra obtained
	with 242.54-nm excitation, have been found to be nearly growth-rate
	and media independent. The excitation wavelength, 222.65 nm, appears
	to be the best yet found for use in rapid Raman identification of
	bacteria. All strong peaks which have been assigned have been attributed
	to protein modes. Relative intensities of 1556-cm-1 tryptophan and
	1616-cm-1 tryptophan+tyrosine bands have been found to be strongly
	correlated with bacterial Gram type and nearly independent of cultural
	media or stage of growth.},

	in its distribution of disulfide rotamers and in the orientation
	of its unique indole side chain (tryptophan-107). These differences
	are attributed, respectively, to N-terminal truncation and factor

	Application of the Raman probes to the engineered TNFR dumbbell,
	which is of interest as a potential therapeutic, shows that TNFR

	(TPS-dGuo) were recorded in non-hydrogen bonding, proton acceptor,
	and proton donor/acceptor solvents. Raman spectral changes observed
	on going from inert to proton acceptor solvents were ascribed to
	the hydrogen bonding at the proton donor sites of the guanine ring(N1-H
	and C2-NH2), and the spectral changes associated with the solvent
	change from proton acceptor to donor/acceptor were ascribed to the
	hydrogen bonding at the proton acceptor sites (N3, C6=0, and N7).
	A Raman band appearing at 1624 cm(-1) in inert solvents is assigned
	mainly to the NH2 scissors mode and its frequency changes to approximate
	to 1640 cm(-1) in acceptor solvents, reflecting the hydrogen bonding
	at C2-NH2. Another band at 1581 cm(-1), arising largely from the
	N1-H bend, shows an upshift of approximate to 10 cm(-1) upon hydrogen
	bonding at either N1-H or acceptor sites. Hydrogen bonding at the
	acceptor sites also produces frequency shifts of other Raman bands
	(at 1710, 1565, 1528, 1481, and 1154 cm(-1) in 1,2-dichloroethane
	solution). Among the Raman bands listed above, the 1710 cm(-1) band
	due to the C6=0 stretch decreases in frequency, whereas the others
	increase. The downshift of the C6=0 stretching frequency is correlated
	with the strength of hydrogen bonding at C6=O. The frequency of the
	1481 cm(-1) band increases with a decrease of the C6=O stretching
	frequency, indicating that the 1481 cm(-1) band is also a marker
	of hydrogen bonding at C6=O. This finding is in sharp contrast to
	the previously proposed correlation with the hydrogen bonding at
	N7. The 1565 cm(-1) band is assigned to a vibration mainly involving
	the N1-C2=N3 linkage, and its frequency increases with increasing
	strength of the hydrogen bond at N3. Three bands around 1315, 1 180,
	and 1030 cm(-1), which are known to be sensitive to the ribose ring
	puckering and glycosidic bond orientation, also show small frequency
	changes upon hydrogen bonding. The Raman marker bands for the hydrogen
	bonds at C2-NH2, N1-H, C6=0, and N3 are expected to be useful in
	studying the structures of nucleic acids and nucleic acid-protein
	complexes containing guanine residues.},

	sections of both the nucleosides and amino acids are strongly dependent
	on excitation wavelength and constitute sensitive and selective probes
	of the residues. The results provide a library of UVRR marker bands

	or acceptor sites on the guanine ring. The Raman bands, which shift
	on C8-deuteration, remain in the difference spectrum between the
	unlabeled and C8-deuterated guanine rings. Among them, a negative

	of the E. coli lac promoter. LacDNA contains four guanine residues
	in the consensus pentamer regions (G5 and G7 on the sense strand
	and G5' and G7' on the anti-sense strand) and they were individually
	labeled with deuterium at C(8) on the guanine ring. In the UV (251
	nm) Raman difference spectrum between unlabeled and C(8)-D-labeled
	LacDNA, a sharp positive/negative peak pair appeared at &SIM; 1490/1465
	cm(-1), which was assigned to a guanine ring vibration (v(6)/v6('))
	sensitive to the hydrogen bonding state at C(6)=O. CRP is a dimeric
	protein and forms two complexes with the cofactor cAMP, i.e. half-filled
	CRP-(cAMP)(1) and fully liganded CRP-(cAMP)(2). The v(6)/v(6)' wavenumbers
	measured in the presence of CRP showed that CRP-(cAMP), binds to
	G5 and G5' in a symmetric manner, whereas CRP-(cAMP)(2) exhibits
	an additional binding to G7. Since the base sequence of LacDNA and
	the structure of CRP-(cAMP), are both asymmetric, the symmetric LacDNA-CRP-(cAMP)(1)
	interaction suggests that CRP-(cAMP)(1), which is considered to be
	dominant under physiological conditions, has a conformational flexibility
	to conform to structural asymmetry of natural DNA sequences. In contrast,
	the symmetric complex CRP-(cAMP)(2) binds to LacDNA asymmetrically,
	suggesting a decreased flexibility of CRP in the fully liganded form.

	This thesis is focused on a plan for the development of a deep UV

	cm-1. The gratings stages are equipped with motors, one of which
	drives a lead screw, and the other is a motorized linear actuator,
	which gives both stages high angular resolution. The stage controlled
	by the lead screw has sufficient resolution to shift the spectrum
	of a particular analyte by a single pixel. The expected efficiency
	of this spectrometer is ~15\%, which is comparable to the efficiency

  abstract = {The photophysical properties of natural nucleobases and their respective nucleotides are ascribed to the sub-picosecond lifetime of their first singlet states in the UV-B region (260-350 nm). Electronic transitions of the pi pi(star) type, which are stronger than those in the UV-B region, lie at the red edge of the UV-C range (100-260 nm) in all isolated nucleobases. The lowest energetic excited states in the UV-B region of nucleobases have been investigated using a plethora of experimental and theoretical methods in gas and solution phases. The sub-picosecond lifetime of these molecules is not a general attribute of all nucleobases but specific to the five primary nucleobases and a few xanthine and methylated derivatives. To determine the overall UV photostability, we aim to understand the effect of more energetic photons lying in the UV-C region on nucleobases. To determine the UV-C initiated photophysics of a nucleobase system, we chose a halogen substituted purine, 6-chloroguanine (6-ClG), that we had investigated previously using resonance Raman spectroscopy. We have performed quantitative measurements of the resonance Raman cross-section across the B-b absorption band (210-230 nm) and constructed the Raman excitation profiles. We modeled the excitation profiles using Lee and Heller's time-dependent theory of resonance Raman intensities to extract the initial excited state dynamics of 6-ClG within 30-50 fs after photoexcitation. We found that imidazole and pyrimidine rings of 6-ClG undergo expansion and contraction, respectively, following photoexcitation to the Bb state. The amount of distortions of the excited state structure from that of the ground state structure is reflected by the total internal reorganization energy that is determined at 112 cm(-1). The contribution of the inertial component of the solvent response towards the total reorganization energy was obtained at 1220 cm(-1). In addition, our simulation also yields an instantaneous response of the first solvation shell within an ultrafast timescale of less than 30 fs following photoexcitation.},

A base pairs in alternating sequence; Although Raman spectra of this structure have been reported previously, the temperature dependence of the Raman bands has not been examined in detail. Using a spectrometer of high spectral precision and sensitivity, we applied Raman difference spectroscopy to determine the temperature dependence of all Raman bands of poly(dA-dT) poly(dA-dT) in physiological salt solutions (both H2O and D2O) over the temperature range 10-85 degrees C, Three temperature domains are distinguished by Raman spectroscopy: premelting (10 < t < 66 degrees C), in which the double-stranded structure is perturbed but does not dissociate; melting (66 < t < 75 degrees C), in which the double-stranded structure dissociates; and postmelting (75 < t < 85 degrees C), in which no structural change can be detected, The results demonstrate that distinct Raman difference signatures exist for the premelting and melting transitions, and that each involves changes in most Raman bands, Among other novel findings and assignments: (i) Raman bands at 728 (dA), 1236 (dT) and 1301 cm(-1) (dA) provide the most sensitive measures of base stacking in both the premelting and melting domains. (ii) Raman bands at 1182 (dT) and 1512 cm(-1) (dA) provide the most sensitive measure of T unpairing in the melting domain, An unexpected finding is the apparent correlation of the 1182 cm(-1) band intensity with the degree of thymine unpairing, Additionally, bands at 1376 (dT) and 1577 cm(-1) (dA) confirm changes in interbase hydrogen bonding with premelting, (iii) The temperature dependence of the Raman band at 819 cm(-1) is closely correlated with those of backbone marker bands at 792 and 842 cm(-1) (O-P-O stretch modes), indicating that the 819 cm(-1) band is due to a vibrational mode localized in the backbone and is diagnostic of phosphodiester torsions alpha/xi apparently specific to the gauche-/trans conformation of B-II DNA, (iv) The Raman band at 1484 cm(-1) (dA) is sensitive to hydrogen bonding at the adenine N1 site, (v) Comparison of spectra from H2O and D2O solutions reveal significant vibrational coupling between Raman bands of the deoxynucleoside residues and B-form backbone of poly(dA-dT) poly(dA-dT). These results constitute an important foundation for future Raman studies of premelting and melting phenomena in other DNA sequences, including poly(dA) poly(dT).

  abstract     = {Infrared, Raman and UV resonance Raman spectra of adenosine and its
	1,3-N-15(2), 2-C-13, and 8-C-13 isotopic analogues were measured
	in neutral aqueous solution (Raman and UV Raman) and in the crystalline
	state (infrared and Raman). The observed isotopic wavenumber shifts
	are useful in distinguishing adenine ring vibrations from ribose
	vibrations. In-plane modes of the adenine ring are selectively enhanced
	in UV resonance Raman spectra, which facilitates the assignment of
	the in-plane vibrations. In addition to the in-plane modes, a ribose
	vibration coupled with adenine in-plane vibrations was identified
	in the UV resonance Raman spectra. The fundamental wavenumbers for
	22 in-plane normal modes of the 9-substituted adenine ring of adenosine
	in the 1700-250 cm-1 region are proposed. Although the fundamental
	wavenumbers of adenosine correspond well with those of adenine above
	1350 cm-1 and below 800 cm-1, the vibrations in the 1350-800 cm-1
	region are appreciably affected by the presence of the N-9-C-1' glycosidic
	bond and the couplings between ribose and adenine ring vibrational
	motions. The adenosine fundamental wavenumbers and their isotopic
	shifts reported here may be useful in analysing vibrational spectra
	of adenine nucleosides and nucleotides and in improving the force
	field of the 9-substituted adenine ring.},

	structure applications is that many prominent Raman marker bands
	of thymidine, assigned previously as thymine ring vibrations, in
	fact involve appreciable coupling with the C2' methylene group of
	the attached sugar. Vibrational coupling between the base and sugar

	pucker and glycosyl orientation in Raman spectra of DNA, antiviral
	drugs, and other thymine-containing nucleoside analogues. The present

	symmetric stretching (2956 cm(-1)), scissoring (1404 cm(-1)), and

  abstract     = {Vibrational spectra of two ribonucleosides containing pyrimidine bases,
	i.e., uridine and cytidine, were analyzed in the solid state at low
	temperature by neutron inelastic scattering (NIS) and in an aqueous
	solution at room temperature by Raman scattering and Fourier transform
	infrared absorption (FT-IR). Analysis of all these experimental spectra,
	measured on both native and deuterated (on labile hydrogens) species,
	allows a complete set of information on the vibrational modes arising
	from the base residues and ribose to be obtained. To interpret the
	vibrational spectra, a harmonic force field has been estimated for
	isolated ribonucleosides at the Hartree-Fock (HF) and density functional
	theory (DFT) levels. All these calculations have been performed by
	means of the Becke-Lee-Yang-Parr (B3LYP) local exchange and correlation
	functional (for DFT calculations) and the split valence basis sets,
	631G(()*()), including nonstandard polarization functions on heavy
	atoms (for DFT and HF calculations). The lowest energy conformers
	of these ribonucleosides, i.e., C3'-endo/ anti and C2'-endo/anti
	have been used in the vibrational mode calculations, where C3'-endo
	and C2'-endo refer to the N-type and S-type ribose puckering, respectively,
	and anti designates the orientation of base with respect to the sugar.
	The absence of any imaginary frequencies in the vibrational calculations
	confirms that the optimized geometry of the ribonucleosides well
	corresponds to their local mimima. The addition of the zero-point
	vibrational energy (ZPVE) to the electronic energy does not, however,
	change the energy order of the conformers. In both ribonucleosides,
	the C3'-endo/anti conformer has a lower energy than the C2'-endo/
	anti one. It has been shown that NIS intensities calculated at the
	DFT/B3LYP/631G(()*()) level account more accurately for the characteristics
	of the experimental spectra. Therefore, the assignment of the observed
	vibrational modes has been extensively discussed in this paper on
	the basis of the results calculated by means of the DFT method. On
	the other hand, comparison between observed and calculated NIS spectra
	of native and deuterated species can give insight on the effect of
	intermolecular hydrogen bonding in the solid phase. Finally, the
	calculated results seem to be able to interpret the Raman marker
	shifts observed upon the A-Z helix transitions of poly- and oligonucleotides
	(C3'-endo/anti to C2/-endo/anti conformational transition of the
	cytosine residue), as well as those related to the UUCG tetraloop
	hairpin, involving C2'-endo/anti uridine and cytidine residues found
	in the middle positions of this highly stable tetraloop.},

We inferred the initial structural dynamics of GMP immediately after photoexcitation in terms of dimensionless displacements: The simulations also provide linewidth-broadening parameters that in turn report on the time scale of dynamics. We compared deduced structural changes in the purine ring upon photoabsorption into the B-b state with those deduced for the-two lowest lying pi pi* (L-a and L-b at 280 and 248 nm, respectively) excited states of GMP. We find that excitation to:the Lb state lengthens C-6-N-1 and C-2=N-3 bonds, which lie along the formation coordinate-of various oxidative adducts but B-b excitation does riot. We also find that photoabsorption by the B-b state weakens the C-8-N-9 bond and thus might assist imidazole ring opening via cleavage of the same bond: Electronic excitation to different pi pi* states of the,guanine chromophore results in contrasting structural changes; although-absbiption by the L-a and L-b states induces expansion Of pyrimidine and contraction of imidazole rings, excitation results-in overall Shrinkage of both the rings. Computed-ahsolute changes in internal coordinates imply that photoexcitation to any of the three/singlet states-of GMP does not lead directly to, the formation of-a cation, radical of guanine.},

  abstract     = {Exchanges of the amino and imino protons in guanine quarters of telomeric
	DNA have been time-resolved by laser Raman spectroscopy. The Raman
	dynamic probe has been applied to parallel and antiparallel quadruplexes
	formed by the telomeric repeat of Oxytricha nova, d(T(4)G(4))(4),
	and to the highly thermostable parallel quadruplex formed by d(G(12)),
	Time-dependent Raman spectra of the d(G(12)) quadruplex reveal two
	characteristic exchange reactions for guanine N2 amino groups. At
	10 degrees C, the pseudo-first-order exchange rates are k(N2H)(10
	degrees C) = 5.7 x 10(-3) and k'(N2H')(10 degrees C) = 1.2 X 10(-2)
	min(-1), assignable to Hoogsteen-hydrogen-bonded and non-hydrogen-bonded
	N2 protons, respectively. These measurements provide the first quantitative
	determination of two kinetically distinct N2 amino proton exchange
	reactions in the guanine quarter and demonstrate that amino group
	rotation about the C2-N2 bond is highly restricted in the quadruplex.
	No exchange of guanine N1 imino sites occurs in d(G(12)) at 10 degrees
	C, and N1 exchange remains slow even at 95 degrees C [k(N1H)(95 degrees
	C) = 2.7 x 10(-2) min(-1)], indicating severe suppression of imino
	exchange in guanine quartets. For both parallel and antiparallel
	quadruplexes of d(T(4)G(4))(4), proton exchange rates decrease in
	the order thymine N3 imino > guanine N2 amino > guanine N1 imino,
	The rapid exchange of thymine N3 imino sites indicates that thymine
	quartets are not stabilized in Oxytricha quadruplexes. The protium
	--> deuterium exchange experiments also establish new guanine Raman
	band assignments. Importantly, the 1603 cm(-1) band is due to in-plane
	bending of N1-H, while the 1644 cm(-1) band involves scissoring of
	the N2 amino group. Accordingly, the 1603 and 1644 cm(-1) bands are
	potentially valuable markers of hydrogen-bonding interactions specific
	to guanine imino and amino sites, respectively. The present findings
	also show that guanine hydrogen bonding and exchange dynamics are
	not interrelated in a simple manner. Despite extraordinary retardation
	of N1 imino proton exchange, Raman markers suggest that Hoogsteen-type
	guanine-guanine hydrogen bonding (N1-H...O=C6) is comparable in strength
	to hydrogen bonding of N1-H with water and, surprisingly, much weaker
	than hydrogen bonding between N1-H and the cytosine N3 acceptor of
	Watson-Crick B DNA.},

The solvent effects were studied by means of the self-consistent reaction field method employing the polarized continuum model. Complete assignments of the vibrational spectra of thymidine in both phases were performed combining the DFT calculations with Pulay's scaled quantum mechanics force field methodology. The bond orders, atomic charges, solvation energies, dipole moments, molecular electrostatic potentials, and force constants parameters were calculated for the three conformers of thymidine in gas phase and aqueous solution. Selected descriptors, such as chemical potential (mu), electronegativity (), global hardness (), global softness (S), and global electrophilicity index () were used to explain the exact nature of the interactions with electrophiles and/or nucleophiles and to predict the behavior of the three conformers of thymidine in gas and aqueous solution phases.

	of nucleic acids were initiated in the late 1960s and soon thereafter
	progressed to studies of synthetic and native nucleic acids and complex
	biological assemblies containing either DNA or RNA. Raman applications
	to nucleic acids have continued to increase in number and diversity
	up to the present time. This paper attempts to provide an overview
	of this large body of work, with emphasis on studies carried out
	during the past decade and focusing on problems of biological interest
	and significance. The specific Raman methodologies included in this
	review of nucleic acid applications are (i) conventional Raman spectroscopy
	(i.e. off-resonance Raman excitation), (ii) ultraviolet resonance
	Raman (UVRR) spectroscopy, and (iii) polarized Raman microspectroscopy.
	For each methodology, the experimentally obtained nucleic acid spectrum
	consists of a number of discrete vibrational bands, most of which
	can be assigned confidently to a base, sugar or phosphate constituent
	of the macromolecule and many of which can be employed as sensitive
	indicators or fingerprints of either local structure, global conformation,
	intermolecular interaction or molecular dynamics. The applications
	selected for review include numerous examples from the authors' laboratories.
	The topics addressed include the influences of base composition,
	base sequence, superhelical stress and drug ligation on nucleic acid
	structure and polymorphism, the thermodynamic parameters governing
	nucleic acid premelting and melting phenomena, the molecular mechanisms
	and determinants of protein/nucleic acid recognition and the structures
	and dynamics of nucleic acids in virus assemblies. Copyright &COPY;

   describe procedures for obtaining thermodynamic parameters from the

   transitions. Key findings include the following: (i) Both
   poly(dA).poly(dT) and poly(dA-dT). poly(dA-dT) exhibit robust premelting

   c-fos serum response element (SREfos). However, previous studies using

   comparative analysis of the three 20-mer DNAs SREfos, SREGfos and
   SREGGfos in aqueous solution. Their CD spectra were of the B-DNA type
   with small differences generated by variations in the mutual arrangement
   of the base pairs. Analysis by singular value decomposition of a set of
   Raman spectra recorded as a function of temperature, revealed a
   premelting transition associated with a conformational shift in the DNA
   double helices from a bent to a linear form. Time-resolved fluorescence
   anisotropy shows that the fluorescein reporter linked to the
   oligonucleotide 5'-ends experiences twisting motions of the double
   helices related to the interconversion between bent and linear
   conformers. The three SREs present various bent populations submitted,
   however, to particular internal dynamics, decisive for the mutual
   adjustment of binding partners and therefore specific complex formation.}},

   information about the geometry and stability of nucleic acid segments.
   Even in cases of simple structural transitions between the folded and
   unfolded states, three types of spectral changes may occur - the actual
   structural transition, the influence of temperature change on the
   oligonucleotide in the folded state, and that in the unfolded state. In
   this work, the temperature dependences of UV resonance Raman
   spectroscopy (RRS) spectra excited at 244 and 257 nm were measured on
   two dodecadeoxynucleotides, duplex and hairpin. In both cases, the total
   base composition was the same, containing (in the folded state) a
   double-strand section of guanine-cytosine (GC) pairs and a central
   section of adenine-thymine (AT) pairs forming a flexible part of the
   double helix in the duplex or the loop in the hairpin. Principal
   component analysis (PCA) showed that UV RRS spectrum, unlike
   non-resonance RS, can reliably distinguish between the three types of
   temperature changes. Spectral images of the changes confirmed the B-form
   double helix of GC sections in both the duplex and hairpin and different
   base positions in AT base sections. Additionally, minimal stacking
   interactions between the bases in the loop and other types of
   interactions of adenine with the bases of the stem in the hairpin were
   shown, and the main effects of heating in the folded state on the GC
   sections manifested weakening of stacking interactions. The results
   demonstrate UV RRS potential for studies of non-canonical nucleic acid
   structures, providing properly analyzed and executed measurements of
   temperature dependence.}},

	in neutral aqueous solution (Raman and UV Raman) and in the crystalline
	state (infrared and Raman). The observed isotopic wavenumber shifts
	are useful in distinguishing adenine ring vibrations from ribose
	vibrations. In-plane modes of the adenine ring are selectively enhanced
	in UV resonance Raman spectra, which facilitates the assignment of
	the in-plane vibrations. In addition to the in-plane modes, a ribose
	vibration coupled with adenine in-plane vibrations was identified
	in the UV resonance Raman spectra. The fundamental wavenumbers for
	22 in-plane normal modes of the 9-substituted adenine ring of adenosine
	in the 1700-250 cm-1 region are proposed. Although the fundamental
	wavenumbers of adenosine correspond well with those of adenine above
	1350 cm-1 and below 800 cm-1, the vibrations in the 1350-800 cm-1
	region are appreciably affected by the presence of the N-9-C-1' glycosidic
	bond and the couplings between ribose and adenine ring vibrational
	motions. The adenosine fundamental wavenumbers and their isotopic
	shifts reported here may be useful in analysing vibrational spectra
	of adenine nucleosides and nucleotides and in improving the force
	field of the 9-substituted adenine ring.},

  abstract     = {NMR and CD data have previously shown the formation of the T-4 tetraloop
	hairpin in aqueous solutions, as well as the possibility of the B-to-Z
	transition in its stem in high salt concentration conditions. It
	has been shown that the stem B-to-Z transition in T-4 hairpins leads
	to S (south)- to N (north)-type conformational changes in the loop
	sugars, as well as anti to syn orientations in the loop bases. In
	this article, we have compared by means of UV absorption, CD, Raman,
	and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), the thermodynamic and structural
	properties of the T-4 and A(4) tetraloop hairpins formed in 5'-d(CGCGCG-TTTT-CGCGCG)-3'
	and 5'-d(CGCGCG-AAAA-CGCGCG)-3', respectively. In presence of 5M
	NaClO4, a complete B-to-Z transition of the stems is first proved
	by CD spectra. UV melting profiles are consistent with a higher thermal
	stability of the T-4 hairpin compared to the A(4) hairpin. Order-to-disorder
	transition of both hairpins has also been analyzed by means of Raman
	spectra recorded as a function of temperature. A clear Z-to-B transition
	of the stem has been confirmed in the T-4 hairpin, and not in the
	A(4) hairpin. With a right-handed stem, Raman and FTIR spectra have
	confirmed the C2'-endo/anti conformation for all the T-4 loop nucleosides.
	With a left-handed stem, a part of the T-4 loop sugars adopt a N-type
	(C3'-endo) conformation, and the C3'-endo/syn conformation seems
	to be the preferred one for the dA residues involved in the A(4)
	tetraloop. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals. Inc.},

	and adenosine were measured. Most in-plane vibrations of the purine

	C(1')-deuteration, while those in the 1100-700-cm-1 region showed
	downshifts. The purine ring vibrations above 1450 cm-1 were unaffected.
	The frequency shifts associated with the C(1')-deuteration are explained
	by assuming couplings of the purine vibrations with a ribose C(1')-H
	bending mode, which involves a hydrogen motion in the plane of N(9)-C(1')-H.
	The purine vibrations that showed upshifts in the 1420-1100-cm-1
	region are originally lowered in frequency by coupling with the ribosyl
	bending mode alpha(CH) around 1420 cm-1 and restore their intrinsic
	frequencies upon shifting of alpha(CH) to alpha(CD) around 1100 cm-1
	in the C(1')-D isotopomers. Some of the upshifted vibrations may
	be further pushed up by coupling with alpha(CD). On the other hand,
	the downshifted purine modes in the 1100-700-cm-1 region do not interact
	with alpha(CH) because of large frequency separations from alpha(CH)
	and retain their intrinsic frequencies in the C(1')-H species. In
	the C(1')-D species, however, alpha(CD) couples with these modes
	and pushes their frequencies downward. The observed C(1')-D frequency
	shifts provide direct evidence of vibrational coupling between the
	base and ribose rings, suggesting that the purine base vibrations
	may be affected by the ribose ring puckering and glycosidic bond
	orientation. Actually, most of the purine vibrations that showed
	significant C(1')-D shifts are known or proved to be conformational
	markers of purine nucleosides and nucleotides. The conformational
	sensitivity of purine vibrations really arises from vibrational coupling
	between the base and ribose rings.},

	220 nm were taken of the triple helix poly(U) . poly(A) . poly(U),
	the double helix poly(A) . poly(U) and a random copolymer poly(AU).
	The experiments were carried out both in H2O and in D2O as solvent.
	It is shown that by appropriate choice of excitation wavelength,
	structure-spectra correlations can be established that allow these
	different conformations to be clearly distinguished. Whereas the
	formation of the double helix poly(A) . poly(U) results in both frequency
	and intensity changes, only minor frequency shifts are discernible
	when we compare the spectra of the double helix and the triple helix
	poly(U) . poly(A) . poly(U). As far as the uracil modes are concerned,
	no significant differences between the spectra of the triple and
	the double helices can be discerned. Therefore the RR-spectra indicate
	a very similar base conformation of the two poly(U) strands in poly(U)
	. poly(A) . poly(U) and that in poly(U) . poly(A). However, there
	are considerable changes in the relative intensities of strong adenine
	modes with 260 nm excitation. For example, the intensity ratio of
	bands around 1480 cm-1 and 1338 cm-1 increases from 0.8 in poly(A),
	and 0.95 in poly(A) . poly(U) to 1.4 in poly(U) . poly(A) . poly(U).
	The spectra suggest that both the poly(U) strands in the triple helix
	are of quite similar structure, whereas the conformation of the poly(A)
	strands changes when triple helix is formed. With 220 nm excitation,
	no prominent marker bands or intensity patterns are found that would
	allow a distinction between double and triple helical conformations.
	The experiments demonstrate that UV-Raman spectroscopy, with its
	possibility to choose an appropriate excitation wavelength adds a
	valuable degree of freedom in identifying different nucleic acid
	structures on the basis of intensity criteria.},

	to the ground state in a manner reminiscent of ethylene. We also
	reinterpret previous studies of N-methylthioacetamide to indicate

	the correctness of the assignment of the peptide conformation sensitive

	228.9-nm and 244-nm excitation wavelengths. Placed between the sample
	and the spectrograph, these filters reflect Rayleigh scattering while
	transmitting Stokes-shifted Raman scattering. We have measured UV
	Raman bands from solid, highly scattering samples down to a 290-cm(-1)
	shift from the Rayleigh line. The high throughput of the filtered
	single-stage spectrograph enables the measurement of UV Raman spectra
	from photo-labile samples, including DNA and the energetic materials
	pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) and trinitrotoluene (TNT), with
	sufficiently low excitation powers and short accumulation times to
	minimize photo-alteration. High S/N UV preresonance and resonance
	Raman are obtained for PETN and TNT within 1 s, indicating the possible
	application of UV Raman spectroscopy as a rapid, highly selective
	screening methodology for the detection of trace levels of contraband
	explosives. Furthermore, the incorporation of these dielectric filters
	within a UV optical-fiber Raman probe head provides simultaneous
	Rayleigh rejection and removal of background silica Raman scattering.
	With the use of a 244-nm UV optical-fiber probe, we measured Raman
	spectra from 100 nM to 10 mu M concentrations of polycyclic aromatic
	hydrocarbon (PAH) in water, even in the presence of an equimolar
	concentration of the visible fluorophore rhodamine 6G (R6G). Thus,

	the W3 frequency makes this band a particularly rich source of information
	in the time-resolved UVRR difference spectra, as the different W3
	components exhibit quite different temporal evolutions. Changes in
	these components were evaluated in terms of environmental effects
	with the aid of excitation profiles (EP's) for the Trp model, 3-methylindole
	in various solvents. Prompt (30 ns) spectral changes were shown,
	on the basis of the W3 assignments, to be associated with displacements
	of the A and E helices on the distal side of the heme pocket in the
	immediate photoproduct. The 1-mu-s transient is characterized by
	an upshifted W17 band, which suggest an intermediate protein structure
	in which the Trp beta-37 R-state H-bond is broken. The Tyr-nu-8a
	and nu-8b (Y8a and Y8b) difference signals are shown to result from
	small upshifts, with a slight intensity loss in Y8a. These changes
	are detected in bands that result from six inequivalent but unresolvable
	Tyr residues. The crystal structures, however, indicate that the
	H-bonding environments of five of these residues differ insignificantly
	between the R and T states, and attention naturally focuses on the
	remaining Tyr-alpha-42 residue. This residue resides in the ''switch''
	region of the alpha-1-beta-2 interface, where it forms an H-bond
	with the carboxylate side chain of Asp-beta-99 only in the T state.
	Elimination of this H-bond via mutations at Asp-beta-99 is known
	to reduce cooperativity by destabilizing the T state. It has long
	been assumed that Tyr-alpha-42 is the proton donor to a deprotonated
	Asp-beta-99 carboxylate in this H-bond. However, this should produce
	a downshift and intensification of Y8b on the basis of other proteins
	with donor Tyr-carboxylate H-bonds and of UVRR spectra of the Tyr
	model, p-cresol in solvents of varying donor and acceptor numbers.
	The observed Y8b upshift and loss of intensity in Y8a is instead
	consistent with Tyr-alpha-42 accepting a proton from a neutral Asp-beta-99
	in this critical H-bond. An acceptor H-bond is readily accommodated
	by the crystallographic coordinates, which show the Asp-beta-99 side
	chain to be in a solvent-inaccessible hydrophobic environment. Whether
	this site can actually support protonation of carboxylate at neutral
	pH is discussed in the context of experimental and computational
	results.},

	functions. In this work supercoiled and relaxed forms of purified
	plasmid DNA pBR322 in dilute aqueous solutions are investigated by
	means of UVRR spectroscopy to assess changes in B-DNA conformation.
	Spectral variation in the C=O and exocyclic NH2 vibration above 1600
	cm(-1) indicate changes in hydrogen bonding. A minor shift of the
	CN stretching mode of adenosine and guanosine at 1487 cm-1 supports
	these findings. Changes in ribose conformation are visible in the
	spectral region 1320-1360 cm(-1) by vibrational coupling of the ribose
	pucker to the vibrations of the purine and pyrimidine bases. The
	intercalating phenanthridinium drug ethidium bromide is known to
	reduce the negative supercoiling of DNA. This change in DNA topology
	is reflected in variations of the UVRR marker bands of DNA identified
	above. Principal component analysis helped to extract the features
	of interest from the complex spectra of the intercalation complex.
	Within the bacterial cells the change in DNA topology is achieved
	by the action of topoisomerases. In this work, the DNA-binding subunit
	GyrA of the enzyme gyrase was extracted from E. coli and applied
	to relaxed and supercoiled pBR322. The observed changes in the vibrational
	signature of the relaxed DNA in the presence of GyrA indicate a change
	of topology towards the supercoiled form. With already supercoiled
	DNA no further change in DNA topology is observed. Copyright (c)

	conformations. The corresponding circular dichroism (CD) spectra
	yield the same features as those of the so-called ''X form'' observed

	Raman spectra of this form were compared with those of the canonical
	B form of poly(dA-dT) obtained using the same UV excitation wavelengths
	(257 and 281 nm). No spectral modification of the adenine bands was
	observed which would imply any C2'-endo/anti to C3'-endo/anti or
	C3'-endo/syn sugar-pucker reorganization of the purine residues,
	as would be expected for the A or Z forms, respectively. Consequently,
	it is assumed that the conformation of adenine residues remains C2'-endo/anti,
	i.e characteristic of the B-DNA structure. In contrast, there is
	much spectral evidence that the sugar-puckering of thymine residues
	is different in the X form compared with that in the B form. Shifts
	and intensity changes in the ring and sugar coupled modes at 665,
	745 and 784 cm(-1) are interpreted in terms of a C3'-endo/anti reorganization
	of thymine residues. This B-X structural transition also induces
	modifications in the thymine C4=0 hydrogen-bond network with opposite
	adenine bases, as reflected in the Variation in intensity of the
	1370 cm(-1) band and splitting of the 1660 cm(-1) band.},

	studies of two related DNA dodecamer duplexes, d(CGCAAATTTGCG)(2)

	gauge the impact of these putative H-bonds on the structural and
	thermodynamic properties of the A(3)T(3) duplex. UVRR and CD spectra

	duplex, is primarily localized to the dA and dT bases, and is associated

	with the premelting transition are not readily detectable for the

	forms three-centered hydrogen bonds at low temperatures, while the
	(AT)3 duplex does not. The enthalpy of this H-bond, estimated from
	the thermally induced frequency shift of the dT C4=O vibrational

	which is unable to form the hairpin. Resonance Raman spectroscopy
	with 257 nm excitation greatly favors the resonance of purines and
	therefore the study of the 3' part of the oligonucleotides. The difference
	spectrum obtained from resonance Raman spectra of C and H showed
	marker peaks specific for hairpin formation. The search for these

	H labeled by fluorophores and either C or H proved that the fluorophores
	do not modify the structure of the hairpin but only the vibrations

	(H(2)TMPyP4) has been shown to be an effective telomerase inhibitor
	by an in vitro assay. Here, we examined the interactions of the H(2)TMPyP4
	with three distinct G-quadruplex DNAs, the parallel-stranded (TG(4)T)4,
	dimer-hairpin-folded (G(4)T(4)G(4))2, and monomer- folded AG(3)(T(2)AG(3))(3),
	by ultraviolet resonance Raman spectroscopy (UVRR), UV-vis absorption
	spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, and surface-enhanced Raman
	spectroscopy (SERS). The data obtained by the continuous variation
	titration method show that the binding stoichiometry of H(2)TMPyP4/G-quadruplex
	is 2:1 for (TG(4)T)4 and 4:1 for (G(4)T(4)G(4))2 or AG(3)(T(2)AG(3))(3).
	The results of SERS spectra, UV-vis absorption titration, and fluorescence
	emission spectra together with the binding stoichiometries reveal
	that two H2TMPyP4 molecules are externally stacked at two ends of
	the parallel (TG(4)T)4 G-quadruplex, whereas H(2)TMPyP4 molecules
	can intercalate within their diagonal or lateral loop regions and
	intervals between two G-tetrads for (G(4)T(4)G(4))2 and AG(3)(T(2)AG(3))(3)
	G-quadruplexes. The binding of H(2)TMPyP4 to (TG(4)T)4 G-quadruplex
	results in the hypochromicity of the UV Raman signal of (TG(4)T)4,
	indicating that the stacking effects between H2TMPyP4 and DNA bases
	are significant. The Raman hyperchromicities and shifts are observed
	after the binding of H(2)TMPyP4 to both (G(4)T(4)G(4))2 and AG(3)(T(2)AG(3))(3)
	G-quadruplexes. This indicates that the intercalative H(2)TMPyP4
	can lengthen the vertical distance between adjacent G-tetrads of
	(G(4)T(4)G(4))2 and AG(3)(T(2)AG(3))(3) and change their conformations.
	The present study provides new insights into the effect of H(2)TMPyP4
	binding on the structures of G-quadruplexes and also demonstrates
	that Raman spectroscopy is an ideal method for examining the interaction
	between drugs and G-quadruplexes.},

  abstract                   = {{Ultraviolet resonance Raman (UVRR) spectroscopy is a label-free method
   to define biomacromolecular interactions with anticancer compounds.
   Using UVRR, we describe the binding interactions of two Pt(II)
   compounds, cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II)) and its isomer,
   transplatin, with nucleotides and genomic DNA. Cisplatin binds to DNA
   and other cellular components and triggers apoptosis, whereas
   transplatin is clinically ineffective. Here, a 244 nm UVRR study shows
   that purine UVRR bands are altered in frequency and intensity when
   mononucleotides are treated with cisplatin. This result is consistent
   with previous suggestions that purine N7 provides the cisplatin-binding
   site. The addition of cisplatin to DNA also causes, changes in the UVRR
   spectrum, consistent with binding of platinum to purine N7 and
   disruption of hydrogen-bonding interactions between base pairs. Equally
   important is that transplatin treatment of DNA generates similar UVRR
   spectral changes, when compared to cisplatin-treated samples. Kinetic
   analysis, performed by monitoring decreases of the 1492 cm(-1) band,
   reveals biphasic kinetics and is consistent with a two-step binding
   mechanism for both platinum compounds. For cisplatin DNA, the rate
   constants (6.8 x 10(-5) and 6.5 X 10(-6) s(-1)) are assigned to the
   formation of monofunctional adducts and to bifunctional, intrastrand
   cross-linking, respectively. In transplatin DNA, there is a 3.4-fold
   decrease in the rate constant of the slow phase, compared with the
   cisplatin samples. This change is attributed to generation of
   interstrand, rather than intrastrand,, adducts. This longer reaction
   time may result in increased competition in the cellular environment and
   account, at least part, for the lower pharmacological efficacy of
   transplatin.}},

	the two lowest lying absorption bands using a theoretical approach
	devised previously.1-3 Since only a fraction of the 2N - 3 in-plane

	the closest possible agreement between the observed and calculated

	possible agreement between the calculated and observed intensities
	of those few vibrations that are strongly active in the ultraviolet
	resonance Raman effect. In particular it is necessary that the force
	constants be adjusted to avoid the calculation of intense Raman lines
	with frequencies that are not observed in the UVRR spectrum. Using
	this criteria, a new force field has been developed that appears
	to give better agreement with the observed UVRR intensities than
	previously published ones. It is suggested that this calculation
	of the UVRR intensities can be used to refine molecular force fields
	in combination with other methods such as isotopic replacement currently
	in use to refine force constants.},

  abstract     = {The effects of explicit hydrogen bonding with H2O on the resonance Raman spectra of uracil and thymine are examined computationally. The three bonding sites in uracil and thymine that form the lowest energy uracil-H2O and thymine-H2O complexes, as well as a more limited number of low-lying ones containing two waters, are considered. The ground state structures are optimized at the PBEO/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory in H2O (C-PCM), and the gradients of the bright excited state (S-1) are computed at the TD-CAM-B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory in H2O (C-PCM). As the resonance Raman spectrum is governed by the ground state normal modes and the excited state Cartesian gradient (within the Herzberg-Teller formalism), the differences between spectra of uracil- and thymine-(H2O)(n), n = 1 or 2, are compared in terms of these two factors. Explicit hydrogen bonding to water is found to cause changes in both relative peak positions and intensities for the resonance Raman spectra of uracil and thymine when compared to the isolated molecules. The effect of hydrogen bonding is primarily on the ground state normal mode character, especially for the high frequency modes (>1600 cm(-1)), rather than on the excited state Cartesian gradients.

   HerzbergTeller short-time dynamics formalism. The ground-state geometry
   is optimized at the levels of PBE0/aug-cc-pVTZ and B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ,
   respectively. The gradient of the bright excited state is computed using
   time-dependent density functional theory and spin-flip time-dependent
   density functional theory. The excited-state calculations are carried
   out in both the gas phase and implicit water using the conductor-like
   polarizable continuum model. The ground-state equilibrium structure is
   found to impact the resulting resonance Raman spectrum significantly.
   The simulated resonance Raman spectrum using the long-range corrected
   functionals, that is, CAMB3LYP and LC-BLYP, and based on the
   PBE0/aug-cc-pVTZ optimized ground-state structure shows better agreement
   with the experimental spectrum than using standard hybrid functionals,
   that is, PBE0 and B3LYP. The solvation effect leads to a change in the
   energetic order of the n -> pi{*} and pi -> pi{*} excited states, and it
   improves the agreement with the experimental spectrum, especially with
   regard to the relative intensities of the peaks with frequencies greater
   than 1600 cm(1).}},

   cruciform structures are formed on inverted repeat (IR) sequences. While
   cruciform formable IRs (CFIRs) are sometimes found in regulatory regions
   of transcription, their function in transcription remains elusive,
   especially in eukaryotes. We found a cluster of CFIRs within the mouse
   Pou5f1 enhancer. Here, we demonstrate that this cluster or some
   member(s) plays an active role in the transcriptional regulation of not
   only Pou5f1, but also Sox2, Nanog, Klf4 and Esrrb. To clarify in vivo
   function of the cluster, we performed genome editing using mouse ES
   cells, in which each of the CFIRs was altered to the corresponding
   mirror repeat sequence. The alterations reduced the level of the Pou5f1
   transcript in the genome-edited cell lines, and elevated those of Sox2,
   Nanog, Klf4 and Esrrb. Furthermore, transcription of non-coding RNAs
   (ncRNAs) within the enhancer was also upregulated in the genome-edited
   cell lines, in a similar manner to Sox2, Nanog, Klf4 and Esrrb. These
   ncRNAs are hypothesized to control the expression of these four
   pluripotency genes. The CFIRs present in the Pou5f1 enhancer seem to be
   important to maintain the integrity of ES cells.}},

  abstract     = {Structural polymorphism of DNA has constantly been evolving from the time of illustration of the double helical model of DNA by Watson and Crick. A variety of non-canonical DNA structures have constantly been documented across the globe. DNA attracted worldwide attention as a carrier of genetic information. In addition to the classical Watson–Crick duplex, DNA can actually adopt diverse structures during its active participation in cellular processes like replication, transcription, recombination and repair. Structures like hairpin, cruciform, triplex, G-triplex, quadruplex, i-motif and other alternative non-canonical DNA structures have been studied at length and have also shown their in vivo occurrence. This review mainly focuses on non-canonical structures adopted by DNA oligonucleotides which have certain prerequisites for their formation in terms of sequence, its length, number and orientation of strands along with varied solution conditions. This conformational polymorphism of DNA might be the basis of different functional properties of a specific set of DNA sequences, further giving some insights for various extremely complicated biological phenomena. Many of these structures have already shown their linkages with diseases like cancer and genetic disorders, hence making them an extremely striking target for structure-specific drug designing and therapeutic applications.},

   spectroscopy in detecting formation of DNA G-quadruplex (G4) and
   differentiating between various G4-folding topologies. As model
   structures, we used a 22-mer human telomere fragment AG(3)(TTAG(3))(3)
   (denoted here as wt) and its two variants with adenine abasic lesions at
   the position 19 (ap19) or at the positions 7, 13, and 19 (ap7-13-19),
   the structures of which were previously characterized. These
   oligonucleotides adopt three basic G4-folds: a basket-type form for wt
   in Na+, a (3+1) hybrid form for ap19 in K+, and a parallel G4 for
   ap7-13-19 in K+, the last one furthermore stabilized at increased
   temperatures. We show that although wt and ap7-13-19 in Na+ adopt
   predominately antiparallel G4-folds, these oligonucleotides in K+
   display several Raman features of parallel G4 folds. Interestingly, ap19
   has a Raman spectrum with some features of parallel G4 folds in both Na+
   and K+ solutions. Raman signals indicative of parallel G4 are most
   obvious with ap7-13-19 in K+. The population of ap7-13-19 guanosines
   (unlike of wt and ap19 in K+) in the C2'-endo/anti geometry gradually
   increases with increasing temperature, reaching its maximum at similar
   to 50 degrees C, where an all-parallel topology is observed. In summary,
   Raman spectroscopy has been proven to distinguish between different
   conformational properties of G4-DNA structures, with reliability
   comparable with circular dichroism spectra, and with the potential to
   provide additional structural information.}},

  abstract                   = {{To maintain genome integrity, segmented double-stranded RNA viruses of
   the Reoviridae family must accurately select and package a complete set
   of up to a dozen distinct genomic RNAs. It is thought that the high
   fidelity segmented genome assembly involves multiple sequence-specific
   RNA-RNA interactions between single-stranded RNA segment precursors.
   These are mediated by virus-encoded non-structural proteins with RNA
   chaperone-like activities, such as rotavirus (RV) NSP2 and avian
   reovirus sigma NS. Here, we compared the abilities of NSP2 and sigma NS
   to mediate sequence-specific interactions between RV genomic segment
   precursors. Despite their similar activities, NSP2 successfully promotes
   inter-segment association, while sigma NS fails to do so. To understand
   the mechanisms underlying such selectivity in promoting inter-molecular
   duplex formation, we compared RNA-binding and helix-unwinding activities
   of both proteins. We demonstrate that octameric NSP2 binds structured
   RNAs with high affinity, resulting in efficient intramolecular RNA helix
   disruption. Hexameric sigma NS oligomerizes into an octamer that binds
   two RNAs, yet it exhibits only limited RNA-unwinding activity compared
   to NSP2. Thus, the formation of inter-segment RNA-RNA interactions is
   governed by both helix-unwinding capacity of the chaperones and
   stability of RNA structure. We propose that this protein-mediated RNA
   selection mechanism may underpin the high fidelity assembly of
   multi-segmented RNA genomes in Reoviridae.}},

	= 0.25; and (ii) poly(rA).2poly(rU) triplex formation at [Mg2+]/[phosphate]
	between 0.25 and 0.5. The enthalpies of these two different processes
	are favorable and similar to each other, similar to-1.6 kcal mol(-1)
	of base pairs. Volume and compressibility effects of the first process
	are positive, 8 cm(3) mol(-1) and 24 x 10(-4) cm(3) mol(-1) bar(-1),
	respectively, and correspond to the release of water molecules from
	the hydration shells of Mg2+ and the polynucleotides. The triplex
	formation is also accompanied by a positive change in compressibility,
	14 x 10(-4) cm(3) mol(-1) bar(-1), but only a small change in volume,
	1 cm(3) mol(-1). A phase diagram has been constructed from the melting
	experiments of poly(rA).poly(rU) at a constant K+ concentration,
	140 mM, and various amounts of Mg2+. Three discrete regions were
	observed, corresponding to single-, double- and triple-stranded complexes.
	The phase boundary corresponding to the transition between double

	preprocessing of extensive datasets taken as a function of gradually
	varied physicochemical parameters, e.g. analyte and/or ligand concentration,
	temperature, pH, pressure, ionic strength, time, etc. For intensity
	normalization, the strong Raman OH stretching band of water in the
	range of 2700-3900 cm(-1) recorded together with the analyte spectrum
	in the fingerprint region below 1800 cm(-1) is employed as internal
	intensity standard. Concomitant dependences of the solvent Raman
	spectra are taken into account and, in some cases, turned into advantage.
	Once the Raman spectra of the solvent are acquired for a particular
	range of the parameter varied, solvent contribution can be subtracted
	correctly from any analyte spectrum taken within this range. The
	procedure presented can be efficiently applied only for the analytes
	having their own Raman signal in the range of OH stretching vibrations
	much weaker than that of the solvent. However, this is the case for
	a great number of biochemical and biological samples. Accuracy, reliability
	and robustness of the method were tested under the conditions of
	spontaneous Raman, resonance Raman and surface-enhanced Raman scattering.
	Serviceability of the method is demonstrated by several real-world

   telomeric DNA under the control of intracellular Na+ and K+ has been
   implicated in the pairing of chromosomes during meiosis. Using Raman
   spectroscopy we have determined the dependence of the interquadruplex
   equilibrium of the telomeric repeat of Oxytricha nova, upon solution
   concentrations of Na+ and K+. Both alkali cations facilitate the
   formation of an antiparallel foldback quadruplex at low concentration,
   and a parallel extended quadruplex at higher concentration. However, K+
   is more effective than Na+ in inducing the parallel association. We
   propose a phase diagram relating d(T(4)G(4))(4) Polymorphism to
   intracellular {[}Na+]/{[}K+] ratios. The phase diagram indicates that
   the interquadruplex equilibrium is highly sensitive to changes in the
   mole fraction of either cation when the total concentration falls within
   the interval 65 to 225 mM, a range which encompasses total of the Na+
   and K+ concentrations occurring in a typical mammalian cell. These
   results support a role for the guanine-rich overhang of eukaryotic DNA
   in promoting chromosome association during meiotic synapsis.}},

   telomeric DNA of Oxytricha nova have been determined by Raman
   spectroscopy. Structural polymorphism is demonstrated for both
   single-stranded {[}d(T(4)G(4))(4)] and double-stranded
   {[}d(G(4)T(4)G(4)).d(C(4)A(4)C(4))] telomere models. In the case of
   d(T(4)G(4))(4), which is a prototype for the single-stranded telomeric
   tail, an interquadruplex equilibrium involving parallel and antiparallel
   strand configurations is shown to be governed by the solution
   concentrations of both Na+ and K+. In both the parallel and antiparallel
   quadruplexes of d(T(4)G(4))(4), the local geometry of the phosphodiester
   backbone is similar to that of canonical B DNA, and associations between
   bases of the guanine quartet involve Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding.
   However, the deoxyguanosine (dG) sugar conformations are significantly
   different in the two quadruplexes. In the extended parallel form, dG
   residues assume only the C2'-endo/anti conformation with respect to
   deoxyribose pucker and glycosyl orientation. In the foldback
   antiparallel form, dG residues are distributed equally between
   C2'-endo/anti and C2'-endo/syn conformations. In the case of
   d(G(4)T(4)G(4)).d(C(4)A(4)C(4)), which serves as a model for the
   double-stranded B DNA regions of Oxytricha telomeres, we show that
   disproportionation of the B form duplex to yield stable parallel
   quadruplexes of the guanine-rich strand occurs reversibly at high
   solution concentrations of either Na+ or K+. The present study reveals
   that both interquadruplex and duplex-quadruplex conversions of Oxytricha
   telomeric DNA are under the control of an alkali cation switch. The
   critical transition region encompasses cation concentrations ({[}Na+] +
   {[}K+] approximate to 150 mM) which approximate those in vivo, implying
   biological significance for the observed structural polymorphism. We
   propose a molecular mechanism for the telomeric DNA transitions which is
   based upon the present spectroscopic results and is consistent with the
   concept of different affinities of Na+ and K+ for the central cavity of
   the guanine quartet. The present results also indicate how antiparallel
   and parallel quadruplexes may be exploited in the control of
   interchromosomal associations during meiotic and mitotic cell division
   cycles.}},
