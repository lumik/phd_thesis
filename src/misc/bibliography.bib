  abstract  = {Guanidiniocarbonyl pyrroles are artificial receptors for the efficient
complexation of carboxylates even in polar solvents such as water. Their
carboxylate binding site (CBS) exhibits an electronic absorption maximum at
similar to 298 nm and can be probed selectively by ultraviolet resonance
Raman (UV RR) scattering. We present a pH-dependent UV RR spectroscopic
investigation of two guanidiniocarbonyl pyrroles in water: the model receptor
CBS-NH2 and the peptide receptor CBS-Lys-Lys-Phe-NH2. UV RR spectra of 1 mM
aqueous solutions with 275 nm laser excitation were recorded between pH 6 and
7. Within this small pH range near the pK(a) of 6.4, protonated and neutral
CBS species are simultaneously present at similar concentrations (acid/base
equilibrium). Using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), the individual
UV RR component spectra of these distinct CBS species were determined without
any a priori knowledge. The pH-dependent UV RR spectra of the small model
receptor CBS-NH2 and the larger peptide receptor CBS-Lys-Lys-Phe-NH2 can both
be described as linear combinations of only two components. Control
experiments at pH 2 and pH 10 show an excellent agreement with the derived
NMF component spectra and confirm their assignment to the protonated and
neutral CBS species, respectively.},

  abstract  = {A new laser has been developed which generates hundreds of milliWatts
	of cw UV power below 260 nm. The laser consists of a small-frame
	Ar+-ion laser which is intracavity doubled with the use of BBO nonlinear
	optical crystals. More than 300 mW are available at 244 and 257 nm,
	while 180, 100, and 30 mW are available at 248, 238, and 228.9 nm,
	respectively. This laser is an ideal source for UV Raman spectroscopy
	since it avoids the nonlinear and saturation problems common with
	the typical pulsed laser excitation sources. It also minimizes thermal
	sample degradation. We demonstrate the increased spectral signal-to-noise
	ratios possible due to the ability to focus the cw laser into a small-volume
	element that can be efficiently imaged into the spectrometer. We
	demonstrate the ability of this laser to excite Raman spectra of
	solid samples such as coal-liquid residuals, and point out the utility
	of the 228.9-nm line for studying aromatic amino acids in proteins.
	We also demonstrate the ability to selectively study pyrene intercalated
	into calf thymus DNA.},

	as compared to a prominent protein tyrosine+tryptophan peak at 1616
	cm-1, on the other, have been attributed to very large variations
	in the RNA content of bacterial cells from culture to culture. The
	spectral changes are observed whenever differences in growth rates
	or variations in cultural media result in substantial changes in
	the amount of ribosomal RNA. In spite of very large cultural effects
	on peak intensities it has been possible to obtain bacterial G+C/A+T
	ratios from these spectra. Specifically, the ratio of the intensity
	of the C (1530 cm-1) peak to the intensity of the A+G peak (1485
	cm-1) when plotted against the known molar percent G+C of the corresponding
	bacterial DNA produces a straight line. Plots have been shown to
	be very nearly growth-time and media independent for fourteen different
	types of bacteria, which range in DNA G+C content from 32 to 66\%.
	Spectra obtained with 222.65-nm light, in contrast with spectra obtained
	with 242.54-nm excitation, have been found to be nearly growth-rate
	and media independent. The excitation wavelength, 222.65 nm, appears
	to be the best yet found for use in rapid Raman identification of
	bacteria. All strong peaks which have been assigned have been attributed
	to protein modes. Relative intensities of 1556-cm-1 tryptophan and
	1616-cm-1 tryptophan+tyrosine bands have been found to be strongly
	correlated with bacterial Gram type and nearly independent of cultural
	media or stage of growth.},

	in its distribution of disulfide rotamers and in the orientation
	of its unique indole side chain (tryptophan-107). These differences
	are attributed, respectively, to N-terminal truncation and factor

	Application of the Raman probes to the engineered TNFR dumbbell,
	which is of interest as a potential therapeutic, shows that TNFR

	(TPS-dGuo) were recorded in non-hydrogen bonding, proton acceptor,
	and proton donor/acceptor solvents. Raman spectral changes observed
	on going from inert to proton acceptor solvents were ascribed to
	the hydrogen bonding at the proton donor sites of the guanine ring(N1-H
	and C2-NH2), and the spectral changes associated with the solvent
	change from proton acceptor to donor/acceptor were ascribed to the
	hydrogen bonding at the proton acceptor sites (N3, C6=0, and N7).
	A Raman band appearing at 1624 cm(-1) in inert solvents is assigned
	mainly to the NH2 scissors mode and its frequency changes to approximate
	to 1640 cm(-1) in acceptor solvents, reflecting the hydrogen bonding
	at C2-NH2. Another band at 1581 cm(-1), arising largely from the
	N1-H bend, shows an upshift of approximate to 10 cm(-1) upon hydrogen
	bonding at either N1-H or acceptor sites. Hydrogen bonding at the
	acceptor sites also produces frequency shifts of other Raman bands
	(at 1710, 1565, 1528, 1481, and 1154 cm(-1) in 1,2-dichloroethane
	solution). Among the Raman bands listed above, the 1710 cm(-1) band
	due to the C6=0 stretch decreases in frequency, whereas the others
	increase. The downshift of the C6=0 stretching frequency is correlated
	with the strength of hydrogen bonding at C6=O. The frequency of the
	1481 cm(-1) band increases with a decrease of the C6=O stretching
	frequency, indicating that the 1481 cm(-1) band is also a marker
	of hydrogen bonding at C6=O. This finding is in sharp contrast to
	the previously proposed correlation with the hydrogen bonding at
	N7. The 1565 cm(-1) band is assigned to a vibration mainly involving
	the N1-C2=N3 linkage, and its frequency increases with increasing
	strength of the hydrogen bond at N3. Three bands around 1315, 1 180,
	and 1030 cm(-1), which are known to be sensitive to the ribose ring
	puckering and glycosidic bond orientation, also show small frequency
	changes upon hydrogen bonding. The Raman marker bands for the hydrogen
	bonds at C2-NH2, N1-H, C6=0, and N3 are expected to be useful in
	studying the structures of nucleic acids and nucleic acid-protein
	complexes containing guanine residues.},

	sections of both the nucleosides and amino acids are strongly dependent
	on excitation wavelength and constitute sensitive and selective probes
	of the residues. The results provide a library of UVRR marker bands

	or acceptor sites on the guanine ring. The Raman bands, which shift
	on C8-deuteration, remain in the difference spectrum between the
	unlabeled and C8-deuterated guanine rings. Among them, a negative

	of the E. coli lac promoter. LacDNA contains four guanine residues
	in the consensus pentamer regions (G5 and G7 on the sense strand
	and G5' and G7' on the anti-sense strand) and they were individually
	labeled with deuterium at C(8) on the guanine ring. In the UV (251
	nm) Raman difference spectrum between unlabeled and C(8)-D-labeled
	LacDNA, a sharp positive/negative peak pair appeared at &SIM; 1490/1465
	cm(-1), which was assigned to a guanine ring vibration (v(6)/v6('))
	sensitive to the hydrogen bonding state at C(6)=O. CRP is a dimeric
	protein and forms two complexes with the cofactor cAMP, i.e. half-filled
	CRP-(cAMP)(1) and fully liganded CRP-(cAMP)(2). The v(6)/v(6)' wavenumbers
	measured in the presence of CRP showed that CRP-(cAMP), binds to
	G5 and G5' in a symmetric manner, whereas CRP-(cAMP)(2) exhibits
	an additional binding to G7. Since the base sequence of LacDNA and
	the structure of CRP-(cAMP), are both asymmetric, the symmetric LacDNA-CRP-(cAMP)(1)
	interaction suggests that CRP-(cAMP)(1), which is considered to be
	dominant under physiological conditions, has a conformational flexibility
	to conform to structural asymmetry of natural DNA sequences. In contrast,
	the symmetric complex CRP-(cAMP)(2) binds to LacDNA asymmetrically,
	suggesting a decreased flexibility of CRP in the fully liganded form.

	This thesis is focused on a plan for the development of a deep UV

	cm-1. The gratings stages are equipped with motors, one of which
	drives a lead screw, and the other is a motorized linear actuator,
	which gives both stages high angular resolution. The stage controlled
	by the lead screw has sufficient resolution to shift the spectrum
	of a particular analyte by a single pixel. The expected efficiency
	of this spectrometer is ~15\%, which is comparable to the efficiency

  abstract = {The photophysical properties of natural nucleobases and their respective nucleotides are ascribed to the sub-picosecond lifetime of their first singlet states in the UV-B region (260-350 nm). Electronic transitions of the pi pi(star) type, which are stronger than those in the UV-B region, lie at the red edge of the UV-C range (100-260 nm) in all isolated nucleobases. The lowest energetic excited states in the UV-B region of nucleobases have been investigated using a plethora of experimental and theoretical methods in gas and solution phases. The sub-picosecond lifetime of these molecules is not a general attribute of all nucleobases but specific to the five primary nucleobases and a few xanthine and methylated derivatives. To determine the overall UV photostability, we aim to understand the effect of more energetic photons lying in the UV-C region on nucleobases. To determine the UV-C initiated photophysics of a nucleobase system, we chose a halogen substituted purine, 6-chloroguanine (6-ClG), that we had investigated previously using resonance Raman spectroscopy. We have performed quantitative measurements of the resonance Raman cross-section across the B-b absorption band (210-230 nm) and constructed the Raman excitation profiles. We modeled the excitation profiles using Lee and Heller's time-dependent theory of resonance Raman intensities to extract the initial excited state dynamics of 6-ClG within 30-50 fs after photoexcitation. We found that imidazole and pyrimidine rings of 6-ClG undergo expansion and contraction, respectively, following photoexcitation to the Bb state. The amount of distortions of the excited state structure from that of the ground state structure is reflected by the total internal reorganization energy that is determined at 112 cm(-1). The contribution of the inertial component of the solvent response towards the total reorganization energy was obtained at 1220 cm(-1). In addition, our simulation also yields an instantaneous response of the first solvation shell within an ultrafast timescale of less than 30 fs following photoexcitation.},

A base pairs in alternating sequence; Although Raman spectra of this structure have been reported previously, the temperature dependence of the Raman bands has not been examined in detail. Using a spectrometer of high spectral precision and sensitivity, we applied Raman difference spectroscopy to determine the temperature dependence of all Raman bands of poly(dA-dT) poly(dA-dT) in physiological salt solutions (both H2O and D2O) over the temperature range 10-85 degrees C, Three temperature domains are distinguished by Raman spectroscopy: premelting (10 < t < 66 degrees C), in which the double-stranded structure is perturbed but does not dissociate; melting (66 < t < 75 degrees C), in which the double-stranded structure dissociates; and postmelting (75 < t < 85 degrees C), in which no structural change can be detected, The results demonstrate that distinct Raman difference signatures exist for the premelting and melting transitions, and that each involves changes in most Raman bands, Among other novel findings and assignments: (i) Raman bands at 728 (dA), 1236 (dT) and 1301 cm(-1) (dA) provide the most sensitive measures of base stacking in both the premelting and melting domains. (ii) Raman bands at 1182 (dT) and 1512 cm(-1) (dA) provide the most sensitive measure of T unpairing in the melting domain, An unexpected finding is the apparent correlation of the 1182 cm(-1) band intensity with the degree of thymine unpairing, Additionally, bands at 1376 (dT) and 1577 cm(-1) (dA) confirm changes in interbase hydrogen bonding with premelting, (iii) The temperature dependence of the Raman band at 819 cm(-1) is closely correlated with those of backbone marker bands at 792 and 842 cm(-1) (O-P-O stretch modes), indicating that the 819 cm(-1) band is due to a vibrational mode localized in the backbone and is diagnostic of phosphodiester torsions alpha/xi apparently specific to the gauche-/trans conformation of B-II DNA, (iv) The Raman band at 1484 cm(-1) (dA) is sensitive to hydrogen bonding at the adenine N1 site, (v) Comparison of spectra from H2O and D2O solutions reveal significant vibrational coupling between Raman bands of the deoxynucleoside residues and B-form backbone of poly(dA-dT) poly(dA-dT). These results constitute an important foundation for future Raman studies of premelting and melting phenomena in other DNA sequences, including poly(dA) poly(dT).

  abstract     = {Infrared, Raman and UV resonance Raman spectra of adenosine and its
	1,3-N-15(2), 2-C-13, and 8-C-13 isotopic analogues were measured
	in neutral aqueous solution (Raman and UV Raman) and in the crystalline
	state (infrared and Raman). The observed isotopic wavenumber shifts
	are useful in distinguishing adenine ring vibrations from ribose
	vibrations. In-plane modes of the adenine ring are selectively enhanced
	in UV resonance Raman spectra, which facilitates the assignment of
	the in-plane vibrations. In addition to the in-plane modes, a ribose
	vibration coupled with adenine in-plane vibrations was identified
	in the UV resonance Raman spectra. The fundamental wavenumbers for
	22 in-plane normal modes of the 9-substituted adenine ring of adenosine
	in the 1700-250 cm-1 region are proposed. Although the fundamental
	wavenumbers of adenosine correspond well with those of adenine above
	1350 cm-1 and below 800 cm-1, the vibrations in the 1350-800 cm-1
	region are appreciably affected by the presence of the N-9-C-1' glycosidic
	bond and the couplings between ribose and adenine ring vibrational
	motions. The adenosine fundamental wavenumbers and their isotopic
	shifts reported here may be useful in analysing vibrational spectra
	of adenine nucleosides and nucleotides and in improving the force
	field of the 9-substituted adenine ring.},

	structure applications is that many prominent Raman marker bands
	of thymidine, assigned previously as thymine ring vibrations, in
	fact involve appreciable coupling with the C2' methylene group of
	the attached sugar. Vibrational coupling between the base and sugar

	pucker and glycosyl orientation in Raman spectra of DNA, antiviral
	drugs, and other thymine-containing nucleoside analogues. The present

	symmetric stretching (2956 cm(-1)), scissoring (1404 cm(-1)), and

  abstract     = {Vibrational spectra of two ribonucleosides containing pyrimidine bases,
	i.e., uridine and cytidine, were analyzed in the solid state at low
	temperature by neutron inelastic scattering (NIS) and in an aqueous
	solution at room temperature by Raman scattering and Fourier transform
	infrared absorption (FT-IR). Analysis of all these experimental spectra,
	measured on both native and deuterated (on labile hydrogens) species,
	allows a complete set of information on the vibrational modes arising
	from the base residues and ribose to be obtained. To interpret the
	vibrational spectra, a harmonic force field has been estimated for
	isolated ribonucleosides at the Hartree-Fock (HF) and density functional
	theory (DFT) levels. All these calculations have been performed by
	means of the Becke-Lee-Yang-Parr (B3LYP) local exchange and correlation
	functional (for DFT calculations) and the split valence basis sets,
	631G(()*()), including nonstandard polarization functions on heavy
	atoms (for DFT and HF calculations). The lowest energy conformers
	of these ribonucleosides, i.e., C3'-endo/ anti and C2'-endo/anti
	have been used in the vibrational mode calculations, where C3'-endo
	and C2'-endo refer to the N-type and S-type ribose puckering, respectively,
	and anti designates the orientation of base with respect to the sugar.
	The absence of any imaginary frequencies in the vibrational calculations
	confirms that the optimized geometry of the ribonucleosides well
	corresponds to their local mimima. The addition of the zero-point
	vibrational energy (ZPVE) to the electronic energy does not, however,
	change the energy order of the conformers. In both ribonucleosides,
	the C3'-endo/anti conformer has a lower energy than the C2'-endo/
	anti one. It has been shown that NIS intensities calculated at the
	DFT/B3LYP/631G(()*()) level account more accurately for the characteristics
	of the experimental spectra. Therefore, the assignment of the observed
	vibrational modes has been extensively discussed in this paper on
	the basis of the results calculated by means of the DFT method. On
	the other hand, comparison between observed and calculated NIS spectra
	of native and deuterated species can give insight on the effect of
	intermolecular hydrogen bonding in the solid phase. Finally, the
	calculated results seem to be able to interpret the Raman marker
	shifts observed upon the A-Z helix transitions of poly- and oligonucleotides
	(C3'-endo/anti to C2/-endo/anti conformational transition of the
	cytosine residue), as well as those related to the UUCG tetraloop
	hairpin, involving C2'-endo/anti uridine and cytidine residues found
	in the middle positions of this highly stable tetraloop.},

We inferred the initial structural dynamics of GMP immediately after photoexcitation in terms of dimensionless displacements: The simulations also provide linewidth-broadening parameters that in turn report on the time scale of dynamics. We compared deduced structural changes in the purine ring upon photoabsorption into the B-b state with those deduced for the-two lowest lying pi pi* (L-a and L-b at 280 and 248 nm, respectively) excited states of GMP. We find that excitation to:the Lb state lengthens C-6-N-1 and C-2=N-3 bonds, which lie along the formation coordinate-of various oxidative adducts but B-b excitation does riot. We also find that photoabsorption by the B-b state weakens the C-8-N-9 bond and thus might assist imidazole ring opening via cleavage of the same bond: Electronic excitation to different pi pi* states of the,guanine chromophore results in contrasting structural changes; although-absbiption by the L-a and L-b states induces expansion Of pyrimidine and contraction of imidazole rings, excitation results-in overall Shrinkage of both the rings. Computed-ahsolute changes in internal coordinates imply that photoexcitation to any of the three/singlet states-of GMP does not lead directly to, the formation of-a cation, radical of guanine.},

  abstract     = {Exchanges of the amino and imino protons in guanine quarters of telomeric
	DNA have been time-resolved by laser Raman spectroscopy. The Raman
	dynamic probe has been applied to parallel and antiparallel quadruplexes
	formed by the telomeric repeat of Oxytricha nova, d(T(4)G(4))(4),
	and to the highly thermostable parallel quadruplex formed by d(G(12)),
	Time-dependent Raman spectra of the d(G(12)) quadruplex reveal two
	characteristic exchange reactions for guanine N2 amino groups. At
	10 degrees C, the pseudo-first-order exchange rates are k(N2H)(10
	degrees C) = 5.7 x 10(-3) and k'(N2H')(10 degrees C) = 1.2 X 10(-2)
	min(-1), assignable to Hoogsteen-hydrogen-bonded and non-hydrogen-bonded
	N2 protons, respectively. These measurements provide the first quantitative
	determination of two kinetically distinct N2 amino proton exchange
	reactions in the guanine quarter and demonstrate that amino group
	rotation about the C2-N2 bond is highly restricted in the quadruplex.
	No exchange of guanine N1 imino sites occurs in d(G(12)) at 10 degrees
	C, and N1 exchange remains slow even at 95 degrees C [k(N1H)(95 degrees
	C) = 2.7 x 10(-2) min(-1)], indicating severe suppression of imino
	exchange in guanine quartets. For both parallel and antiparallel
	quadruplexes of d(T(4)G(4))(4), proton exchange rates decrease in
	the order thymine N3 imino > guanine N2 amino > guanine N1 imino,
	The rapid exchange of thymine N3 imino sites indicates that thymine
	quartets are not stabilized in Oxytricha quadruplexes. The protium
	--> deuterium exchange experiments also establish new guanine Raman
	band assignments. Importantly, the 1603 cm(-1) band is due to in-plane
	bending of N1-H, while the 1644 cm(-1) band involves scissoring of
	the N2 amino group. Accordingly, the 1603 and 1644 cm(-1) bands are
	potentially valuable markers of hydrogen-bonding interactions specific
	to guanine imino and amino sites, respectively. The present findings
	also show that guanine hydrogen bonding and exchange dynamics are
	not interrelated in a simple manner. Despite extraordinary retardation
	of N1 imino proton exchange, Raman markers suggest that Hoogsteen-type
	guanine-guanine hydrogen bonding (N1-H...O=C6) is comparable in strength
	to hydrogen bonding of N1-H with water and, surprisingly, much weaker
	than hydrogen bonding between N1-H and the cytosine N3 acceptor of
	Watson-Crick B DNA.},

The solvent effects were studied by means of the self-consistent reaction field method employing the polarized continuum model. Complete assignments of the vibrational spectra of thymidine in both phases were performed combining the DFT calculations with Pulay's scaled quantum mechanics force field methodology. The bond orders, atomic charges, solvation energies, dipole moments, molecular electrostatic potentials, and force constants parameters were calculated for the three conformers of thymidine in gas phase and aqueous solution. Selected descriptors, such as chemical potential (mu), electronegativity (), global hardness (), global softness (S), and global electrophilicity index () were used to explain the exact nature of the interactions with electrophiles and/or nucleophiles and to predict the behavior of the three conformers of thymidine in gas and aqueous solution phases.

	of nucleic acids were initiated in the late 1960s and soon thereafter
	progressed to studies of synthetic and native nucleic acids and complex
	biological assemblies containing either DNA or RNA. Raman applications
	to nucleic acids have continued to increase in number and diversity
	up to the present time. This paper attempts to provide an overview
	of this large body of work, with emphasis on studies carried out
	during the past decade and focusing on problems of biological interest
	and significance. The specific Raman methodologies included in this
	review of nucleic acid applications are (i) conventional Raman spectroscopy
	(i.e. off-resonance Raman excitation), (ii) ultraviolet resonance
	Raman (UVRR) spectroscopy, and (iii) polarized Raman microspectroscopy.
	For each methodology, the experimentally obtained nucleic acid spectrum
	consists of a number of discrete vibrational bands, most of which
	can be assigned confidently to a base, sugar or phosphate constituent
	of the macromolecule and many of which can be employed as sensitive
	indicators or fingerprints of either local structure, global conformation,
	intermolecular interaction or molecular dynamics. The applications
	selected for review include numerous examples from the authors' laboratories.
	The topics addressed include the influences of base composition,
	base sequence, superhelical stress and drug ligation on nucleic acid
	structure and polymorphism, the thermodynamic parameters governing
	nucleic acid premelting and melting phenomena, the molecular mechanisms
	and determinants of protein/nucleic acid recognition and the structures
	and dynamics of nucleic acids in virus assemblies. Copyright &COPY;

   describe procedures for obtaining thermodynamic parameters from the

   transitions. Key findings include the following: (i) Both
   poly(dA).poly(dT) and poly(dA-dT). poly(dA-dT) exhibit robust premelting

   c-fos serum response element (SREfos). However, previous studies using

   comparative analysis of the three 20-mer DNAs SREfos, SREGfos and
   SREGGfos in aqueous solution. Their CD spectra were of the B-DNA type
   with small differences generated by variations in the mutual arrangement
   of the base pairs. Analysis by singular value decomposition of a set of
   Raman spectra recorded as a function of temperature, revealed a
   premelting transition associated with a conformational shift in the DNA
   double helices from a bent to a linear form. Time-resolved fluorescence
   anisotropy shows that the fluorescein reporter linked to the
   oligonucleotide 5'-ends experiences twisting motions of the double
   helices related to the interconversion between bent and linear
   conformers. The three SREs present various bent populations submitted,
   however, to particular internal dynamics, decisive for the mutual
   adjustment of binding partners and therefore specific complex formation.}},

  abstract                   = {{Temperature dependence of vibrational spectra provides important
   information about the geometry and stability of nucleic acid segments.
   Even in cases of simple structural transitions between the folded and
   unfolded states, three types of spectral changes may occur - the actual
   structural transition, the influence of temperature change on the
   oligonucleotide in the folded state, and that in the unfolded state. In
   this work, the temperature dependences of UV resonance Raman
   spectroscopy (RRS) spectra excited at 244 and 257 nm were measured on
   two dodecadeoxynucleotides, duplex and hairpin. In both cases, the total
   base composition was the same, containing (in the folded state) a
   double-strand section of guanine-cytosine (GC) pairs and a central
   section of adenine-thymine (AT) pairs forming a flexible part of the
   double helix in the duplex or the loop in the hairpin. Principal
   component analysis (PCA) showed that UV RRS spectrum, unlike
   non-resonance RS, can reliably distinguish between the three types of
   temperature changes. Spectral images of the changes confirmed the B-form
   double helix of GC sections in both the duplex and hairpin and different
   base positions in AT base sections. Additionally, minimal stacking
   interactions between the bases in the loop and other types of
   interactions of adenine with the bases of the stem in the hairpin were
   shown, and the main effects of heating in the folded state on the GC
   sections manifested weakening of stacking interactions. The results
   demonstrate UV RRS potential for studies of non-canonical nucleic acid
   structures, providing properly analyzed and executed measurements of
   temperature dependence.}},

  abstract     = {Infrared, Raman and UV resonance Raman spectra of adenosine and its
	1,3-N-15(2), 2-C-13, and 8-C-13 isotopic analogues were measured
	in neutral aqueous solution (Raman and UV Raman) and in the crystalline
	state (infrared and Raman). The observed isotopic wavenumber shifts
	are useful in distinguishing adenine ring vibrations from ribose
	vibrations. In-plane modes of the adenine ring are selectively enhanced
	in UV resonance Raman spectra, which facilitates the assignment of
	the in-plane vibrations. In addition to the in-plane modes, a ribose
	vibration coupled with adenine in-plane vibrations was identified
	in the UV resonance Raman spectra. The fundamental wavenumbers for
	22 in-plane normal modes of the 9-substituted adenine ring of adenosine
	in the 1700-250 cm-1 region are proposed. Although the fundamental
	wavenumbers of adenosine correspond well with those of adenine above
	1350 cm-1 and below 800 cm-1, the vibrations in the 1350-800 cm-1
	region are appreciably affected by the presence of the N-9-C-1' glycosidic
	bond and the couplings between ribose and adenine ring vibrational
	motions. The adenosine fundamental wavenumbers and their isotopic
	shifts reported here may be useful in analysing vibrational spectra
	of adenine nucleosides and nucleotides and in improving the force
	field of the 9-substituted adenine ring.},

  abstract     = {NMR and CD data have previously shown the formation of the T-4 tetraloop
	hairpin in aqueous solutions, as well as the possibility of the B-to-Z
	transition in its stem in high salt concentration conditions. It
	has been shown that the stem B-to-Z transition in T-4 hairpins leads
	to S (south)- to N (north)-type conformational changes in the loop
	sugars, as well as anti to syn orientations in the loop bases. In
	this article, we have compared by means of UV absorption, CD, Raman,
	and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), the thermodynamic and structural
	properties of the T-4 and A(4) tetraloop hairpins formed in 5'-d(CGCGCG-TTTT-CGCGCG)-3'
	and 5'-d(CGCGCG-AAAA-CGCGCG)-3', respectively. In presence of 5M
	NaClO4, a complete B-to-Z transition of the stems is first proved
	by CD spectra. UV melting profiles are consistent with a higher thermal
	stability of the T-4 hairpin compared to the A(4) hairpin. Order-to-disorder
	transition of both hairpins has also been analyzed by means of Raman
	spectra recorded as a function of temperature. A clear Z-to-B transition
	of the stem has been confirmed in the T-4 hairpin, and not in the
	A(4) hairpin. With a right-handed stem, Raman and FTIR spectra have
	confirmed the C2'-endo/anti conformation for all the T-4 loop nucleosides.
	With a left-handed stem, a part of the T-4 loop sugars adopt a N-type
	(C3'-endo) conformation, and the C3'-endo/syn conformation seems
	to be the preferred one for the dA residues involved in the A(4)
	tetraloop. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals. Inc.},
