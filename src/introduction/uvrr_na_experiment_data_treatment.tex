\subsection{Data treatment and analysis}

Within the published UV RRS studies of nucleic acids, some advanced
mathematical methods of data treatment and analysis have been applied.
A method of noise and background correction by a filtration in the Fourier
space was developed and applied by
\textcite{Laigle1982}.
To decompose overlapping UV RRS lines a combination of maximum entropy and
Fourier self-deconvolution was employed
\parencite{Efremov1991}.
To visualize the coordination of the effects of a photo- or thermally induced
damage of 12- and 18-mer AT oligomers, the method of two-dimensional
correlation spectroscopy was used
\parencite{Jirasek2006}.
Another approach for analysis of a spectral set, the principal component
analysis was employed to extract the features of interest from UV RRS spectra
of ethidium bromide intercalating supercoiled DNA plasmid
\parencite{Neugebauer2007}.
