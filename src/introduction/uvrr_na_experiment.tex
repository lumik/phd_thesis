\section{Experimental Approach}

Within the fifty years from the first published works dealing with UV RRS
measurements of NA, the devices used have changed according to the technical
progress and the growth experience with this type of experiment.
We concentrate on the main parts of UV RRS spectrometers, including the way of
the sample placement.
