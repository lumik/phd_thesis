\subsection{Experimental Approach}

Within the about fifty years from the first published works dealing with UV RRS
measurements of NA, the devices used have change accordingly to the technical
progress but also to the growth experience with this type of experiments.
We concentrate on the main parts of UV RRS spectrometers including the way of
the sample placement.
