\subsection{Excitation sources}

It is typical for the first two decades that a significant number of various
laser sources were employed to reach an intensive excitation at various UV
wavelengths.
As a rule, pulse lasers with high peak power were chosen to reach the high
efficiency of nonlinear effects serving for the wavelength transformation.

Frequency-doubled pulsed high-power Ar\textsuperscript{+} laser was used for
excitation at 257\,nm

}.
Pulsed Nd:YAG lasers, as a rule of low repetition frequency, were employed
mainly to obtain 266\,nm or 213\,nm wavelengths as the fourth and the fifth
harmonic, respectively
\parencite{%
	Ziegler1981,%
	Toyama1993%
}.
Other wavelengths were obtained using higher harmonics
\parencite{Kubasek1985}
and \ch{H2} Raman shift cell
\parencite{%
	Fodor1985,%
	Nishimura1987%
}.
211\,nm radiation was obtained using sum-frequency mixing of the second and
third harmonics of a
\emph{continuous-wave} (cw)
mode-locked Nd:YLF laser operating at 76\,MHz
\parencite{Leonard1994}.
Excimer lasers were also employed
\parencite{Ziegler1983}.

Continuously tunable UV radiation was obtained by frequency-doubled pulsed dye
lasers, firstly pumped by a flash lamp
\parencite{%
	Asher1977,%
	Blazej1977%
},
which enables to obtain wavelengths above 265\,nm.
Later on, frequency-doubled synchronously pumped dye lasers providing high
repetition ps pulses were used for excitation with relatively low average
power tunable down to 285\,nm
\parencite{%
	Bushaw1978,%
	Samanta1982,%
	Benson1992%
}.
An excitation source tunable in an extensive range of 217â€“750 nm was designed
using a frequency-doubled or tripled 20\,Hz Nd:YAG laser to pump a dye laser
\parencite{Asher1983}.
UV wavelengths were obtained by a nonlinear mixing or frequency doubling.
An excimer-pumped dye-laser system with subsequent frequency doubling provided
wavelengths were continuously adjustable down to 205\,nm
\parencite{Gfrorer1993a}.

At the beginning of the nineties, the quantity of obtained experimental
data allowed for general conclusions concerning UV RRS spectra of NA
obtained using pulse lasers.
Although the substantial resonance enhancement led to high
\emph{signal-to-noise ratio} (SNR), the typical SNR remained far below the
theoretical limit for high-pulse energy excitation.
Moreover, disaccords of Raman intensity data, in particular the excitation RRS
profiles, obtained in different laboratories were presented (e.g.,
\cite{Bushaw1980}).
The optical excitation sampling limitations, dielectric breakdown, and other
nonlinear optical phenomena
\parencite{Teraoka1990},
and Raman saturation phenomena
\parencite{%
	Harmon1990,%
	Johnson1986,%
	Ludwig1988a,%
	Song1991a,%
	Sweeney1990,%
	Teraoka1990%
}
were specified as the reasons.

At the same time, the cw Ar\textsuperscript{+} ion laser with intracavity
doubling has appeared as a new UV source providing 257, 248, 244, 238 and
228.9\,nm excitations
\parencite{%
	Asher1993b,%
	Russell1995%
}.
Due to the cw regime, its use lowered nonlinear sample photochemistry, sample
thermal degradation, and ground-state saturation.
The beam could be focused to a small sample volume, which could be efficiently
collected; this capability resulted in very high spectral SNR.
