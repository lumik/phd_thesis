\subsection{Spinning cell design}
\label{introduction_spinning_cell}

Spinning cells for sample placement are used in resonance Raman spectropy for
long time.
\textcite{Kiefer1971}
reported spinning cell which elimited the difficulties connected with
excitation laser interaction with samples and increased the observed Raman
intensity by a factor of about 10. A schematic diagram of the cell is given in
\figref{introduction_spinning_cell:1971Kiefer_rotating_cell}.
They used cylindrical quartz cell with outer diameter of 60\,mm and a height
of 25\,mm glued to circular piece of brass. The rotation speed could vary from
0 to 3000 rpm. The cell could contain maximally $\sim 65$\,mL of liquid, but
only $\sim 15$ mL were necessary for measurement, because the liquid is driven
to the walls of the cell by centrifugal force.

\textcite{Shriver1974} improved the design of the spinning cell holder. They
used pyrex tubes which could be directly inserted into the holder. The tube
was secured inside holder by split nylon cone compressed by knurled aluminium
nut attached to aluminium body of chuck (see
\figref{introduction_spinning_cell:1974Shriver_spinning_cell}).
The cell could contain 1mL samples or less for measurement in which case the
spectra were obtained from thin film of the liquid on the sides of the cell.

	collecting lens, M is the small front surface mirror. C is the sample chuck.

	constructed to minimize wobble of the sample tube, which decreases the Raman
	signal at high absorber concentrations. Adapted from \textcite{Shriver1974}.%

Similar cells using the above mentioned design approaches were then regularly
used in resonance Raman studies, see
\cref{introduction_sample_placement}.
