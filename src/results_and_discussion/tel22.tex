One class of the unusual nucleic acid conformations are
\emph{guanine quadruplexes} (GQ)
which are formed by stacked planar guanine tetrads.
The structure is stabilized by Hoogsteen base pairing and cation coordination.
GQ are abundant within human DNA and their presence in telomeric guanine-rich
regions of human core telomeric repeats \ch{d[TTAG3]_n} is well known.
It was also observed that the GQ exhibit remarkable polymorphism especially
those stabilized by \ch{K^+} ions
\parencite{Chaires2013}.

It is interesting to investigate GQ in the molecular crowding environment,
physiological temperatures and in presence of \ch{K^+} ions which is mimicking
their actual in vivo conditions in cells.
Recent in vitro studies revealed that DNA concentration and thermal treatment
of the sample may play important role in GQ folding and interquadruplex
transitions
\parencite{Palacky2013}.

Circular dichroism and conventional Raman spectroscopy revealed that
thermodynamically equilibrated (heated and slowly cooled) samples of Tel22
changes from antiparallel to hybrid “3 + 1” and parallel form and that
the fraction of the parallel form is larger with the concentration of the
oligonucleotide or \ch{K^+} ions
\parencite{Palacky2013}.

The influence of slightly increased, but safely below the denaturation,
temperature of 37\,\textdegree{}C on highly concentrated (310\,mM
in phospahtes as a model for highly crowded conditions) \ch{d[AG3(TTAG3)3]}
(Tel22) was studied.
The samples were proved by Raman spectroscopy to accomodate the antiparallel
conformation in an environment without \ch{K^+} ions (75\,mM \ch{Na^+-PBS}
buffer with overall concentration 150\,mM of \ch{Na^+} ions) and that this
conformation is extremely stable, i.e. the antiparallel conformation was
preserved after anealing, long term storage, slight temperature increase, high
\ch{Na^+} ion concentration (up to 1120\,mM).

When \ch{K^+} ions were added to 450\,mM concentration a very swift spectral
change occurs ($< 1$\,min) which indicates replacement of \ch{Na^+} by
\ch{K^+} ions and \ch{K^+}-antiparallel quadruplex formation which after
some time changes its conformation to “3 + 1”.

Transition to parallel qudruplex form can be observed with progressing time
(72\,hours in total) if such sample is incubated at physiological temperature
of 37\,\textdegree{}C, which is far below the melting point under given
conditions ($> 75$\,\textdegree{}C) as indicated by increase of intensity of
1337\,\icm{} (marker of \ch{"C2'"}-endo/anti-dG) and decrease of
1326\,\icm{} (marker of \ch{"C2'"}-endo/syn-dG) band

}.
Furthemore the samples incubated at 37\,\textdegree{}C remain fluid even after
the transition to the parallel form.

The similar spectral change can be seen for the same sample after anealing
(heating to 95\,\textdegree{}C and slowly cooling down to 20\,\textdegree{}C)
but the resulting sample forms a stiff gel.

NMR spectroscopy of the resulting parallel GQ samples suggested that the
incubation of the Tel22 sample at physiological temperature forms
intramolecular quadruplexes because NMR signal is much lower which suggests
small randomly oriented complexes stabilized by van der Waals interactions
whereas the anealed samples form more stable higher-order intermolecular
structures indicated by stronger NMR signal.
This observation also explains why incubation results in fluid samples and
anealing in gel
\parencite[publication in preparation]{Lindnerova-Mudronova2022}.

This process suggests that the parallel GQ is energetically the most favorable
form.
To confirm the results from visible Raman spectroscopy and overcome problems
with fluorescence the samples were diluted to 200\,\g{m}M concentration,
stored for 10 days at 5\,\textdegree{}C and measured on UVRR spectrometer with
2\,mW of 244\,nm laser at sample in 30 frames of 120\,s scans.
A 3\,mL of the sample was stirred in silica glass spectroscopic cells during
the measurement to prevent photodecomposition.
All measurements were performed at 10°C.
Background signals of PBS buffer and quartz cell were subtracted.

\Figref{telXXII:spectra} shows the results for thermally pristine samples
which were stored at 5\,\textdegree{}C, 37\,\textdegree{}C incubated samples
and samples after anealing.
During the 72\,h incubation, the conversion from “3 + 1” conformation which
has guanine in C2'-endo/syn conformation (guanine band at 1325\,\icm{}) to
parallel conformation with guanine in C2'-endo/anti conformation (guanine
band at 1338\,\icm{}) is not finished (see \cref{interpretation}).
The spectra also confirm that the conformation is stable even after dilution
and storage for 10 days.

These results confirm that UVRR spectroscopy can be used for studying of
different unusual NA conformations such as GQ. It also extends available
concentration ranges and can be used for investigation of stability of
nucleic acid complexes while keeping structural information contained in the
vibrational spectra.
