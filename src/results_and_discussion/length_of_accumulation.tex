\subsection{The course of the signal accumulation}

A Raman spectrum is usually acquired as a consecutive series of spectra,
further called \emph{frames}, taken at the same experimental conditions and
with the constant accumulation time.
This approach has many reasons.
Amongst the most important is that measurement of Raman spectra requires highly
sensitive detectors which means that detector saturation can be easily reached
with a stronger signal.

Secondly, such sensitive detectors are susceptible to cosmic ray artifacts,
which can significantly damage the spectra, see
\cref{subsec:spike_removal}.
It is easier to subtract the cosmic ray signal in the series of spectra taken
with the same measurement condition than from a single spectrum because the
subsequent spectra should be almost identical, and the average of the
surrounding spectra can replace the spectral regions with cosmic ray signal.

Furthermore, other temporal effects can affect the spectra, like slight
temperature variations, mechanical movements etc.

RRS is also affected by photodecomposition and an increasing presence of
photoproducts which can directly or indirectly influence the measured spectra.
The direct presence of a signal of photoproducts in the detected spectra is
usually negligible because Raman scattering of the photoproducts is not usually
resonantly enhanced.
However, indirect effects through chemical interactions of photo products with
the system under investigation are always possible.

So, measurement of more frames with a shorter accumulation time would be
favored for better monitoring of all these processes during the accumulation of
the spectrum.

However, there are also opposite effects that support longer measurements.
The most dominant is the ratio between the signal from the sample and noise.
The noise in the spectra can have many origins, but dominant are those
connected with acquiring the signal on the CCD detector.
The first one is low-frequency (almost constant) background which is usually
used in SNR calculation.
Best results with the most linear response to the intensity of the gathered
light are achieved with a signal in the range $\approx 10 -- 80\,\%$ of the
maximal signal limit.
The second component is high-frequency noise which lowers the quality of the
spectra, reliability of the band position detection, or can even hide some
spectral features completely.

We tried to estimate some guiding principles about a balance between a number
of frames and an accumulation time.
We measured the background spectrum of deionized water with high laser power
(100\,mW), which meant short accumulation times (5\,s) taken in 100 frames.
All these frames were then averaged to obtain one high quality Raman spectrum
of water $I_\text{water}(\wn)$ as a reference.
Then we measured the same water with 1\,mW excitation in 30 frames with 20\,s
accumulation time and 10 frames with 60\,s accumulation time which are
parameters of our typical RRS measurement. We summed all the frames to obtain a
single Raman spectrum $I_{20}(\wn)$ and $I_{60}(\wn)$, so both of them
represented 10 min total accumulation.

We decided to assess the SNR to estimate the quality of the measured spectra.
The noise height was estimated by a fit of the high-quality water spectrum
$I_\text{water}(\wn)$ plus constant background, which resulted in the model
intensity function
\begin{equation}
	I_\text{model}(\wn) = a_0 I_\text{water}(\wn) + a_1.
	\label{\eqnlabel{accum_length:sn_model}}
\end{equation}
An example fit can be seen in
\figref{accum_length:sn_ratio}.

		The original \emph{spectrum} (here, we are using the spectrum $I_{20}(\wn)$
		with 20\,s accumulation time) was modeled by \emph{model}
		\eqnref{accum_length:sn_model}.
		The spectra on the image were then normalized to the \emph{constant} $a_1$.
	}
	\label{\figlabel{accum_length:sn_ratio}}
\end{figure}

The low-frequency SNR was then estimated as
\begin{equation*}
	SNR_\text{low} = \frac{I_\text{model}(1637)}{a_1},
\end{equation*}
which leads to
\begin{align*}
	SNR_{\text{low},20} &= 1.3841 \pm 0.0004, \\
	SNR_{\text{low},60} &= 2.6112 \pm 0.0026,
\end{align*}

We also estimated the high-frequency noise.
We subtracted the constant $a_1$ from the measured spectra and normalized them
to the maximum of the $I_\text{model}(1637\,\text{cm}^{-1})$ to compare the
noise size to the size of this band.
We then calculated spectrum $I_\text{SG}$ smoothed by Savitzky-Golay filter
\parencite{Savitzky1964},
see
\figref{accum_length:sn_ratio_sg}.

	\centering
	\input{results_and_discussion/assets/sn_ratio/sn_ratio_sg}

		the Savitzky-Golay filter (\emph{SG filter}).
	}
	\label{\figlabel{accum_length:sn_ratio_sg}}
\end{figure}

Finally, we estimated the high-frequency $SNR_\text{high}$ from the standard
deviation $\sigma$ of the original spectrum from the smoothed spectrum
normalized to the intensity of the water band at 1637\,\icm{} (which means that
the normalized intensity maximum at 1637\,\icm{} is equal to 1),
\begin{equation*}
	SNR_\text{high} = \frac{1}{\sigma},
\end{equation*}
\begin{align*}
	SNR_{\text{high},20} &= 240, \\
	SNR_{\text{high},60} &= 297.
\end{align*}

It can be seen that longer single-frame accumulation times give better quality
spectra in these experimental conditions.
The difference is larger in the low-frequency SNR even though the
high-frequency SNR difference is also significant.
Regarding the disadvantages of the
longer accumulation discussed at the beginning of this section and the speed of
the sample degradation with lifetimes in the range of minutes, we decided that
the optimal accumulation time is 60\,s.
