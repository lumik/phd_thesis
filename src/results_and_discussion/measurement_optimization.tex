\section{Optimization of the experiment}

Optimal measurement conditions are one of the requirements for high-quality
scientific results.
Many adjustable parameters can influence the measurement quality, and their
optimal values highly depend on the samples under investigation.
The further analysis focuses on optimizing measurement parameters of nucleic
acids using 244 and 257\,nm excitation wavelengths.
PolyU was chosen as the sample for these experiments because uracil is known to
be the most susceptible base for photodecomposition, and our further
experiments were conducted on oligo and polynucleotides, and thus polyU is a
better model molecule than, for example, mononucleotide UMP.
The main parameters which needed to be determined were excitation laser power,
length of accumulation, sample volume, and concentration.
Moreover, the optimal sample rotation speed needed to be found for the
experiments using the spinning cell.
