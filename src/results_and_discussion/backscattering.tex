\subsection{Redesign for backscattering}
\begin{docitemize}
	\item Present new schema
	\item Briefly describe new optics
	\item Present schema of mirror holder right in front of Cassegrain
\end{docitemize}

	\caption{Top-view schema of the apparatus in backscattering configuration
		and with side-view inset of the sample space. Small right-angle prism in
		total reflection configuration M4 is placed to the same position where
		previously was sample and Cassegrain objective O is moved forward in such
		a way that M4 is right before its blind spot. The explanation of rest of
		the symbols is the same as in
		\figref{multiple_excitations:apparatus_schema}.}
