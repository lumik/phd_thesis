\subsection{Concentration optimization}

The next step was to determine the optimal concentration of the measured NA
sample in respect to its photodamage.
First, we tried to estimate the dependence of the lifetime on concentration. We
used the same sample preparation as described in
\cref{subsec:power_optim}
but with variable concentration of samples of 500\,\g{m}M and 1000\,\g{m}M per
nucleobase and 1\,mW of excitation laser power. We also used the same data
treatment as in the previous section. We weren't able to detect fast decay
component for 500\,\g{m}M samples in this measurement so we tried to compare
at least the slow decay components the same way as in the previous section.
The results can be seen in
\figref{conc_optim:triplexes}
and
\tabref{conc_optim:lifetimes_triplexes}.

\end{table}

First of all, it is important to notice that there is variation in the
estimated lifetime between this measurement and results from previous section
\tabref{power_optim:lifetimes_triplexes2}. The difference between these two
measurements was that we used larger slit width (70 \g{m}M instead of 50 \g{m}m
used in the previous section) which could have impact on the decay curve
because as we showed in the previous section the photodecomposition process
is very complex and involves changes in the sample absorbance which can have
large impact on the focus because of the anomalous dispersion.

The second observation is, that the lifetime seems to depend almost linearly on
the concentration which is proportional to the number of nucleotides in the
sample. This means that in our right angle experimental configuration all the
excitation laser energy is absorbed in the sample for both concentrations and
that the number of photodecomposed molecules is proportional to the absorbed
energy in this concentration range and the excitation laser power density
doesn't significantly influence the photodecomposition process.

This analysis means that samples can endure longer measurements on higher
concentrations. On the other hand, higher concentrations are also less cost
effective because they require more samples and it is harder to adjust focus
for them, the spectra are also more influenced by the signal of the sample cell
because you need to focus closer to the cell wall and floor. 1000\,\g{m}M
concentration was the highest practical value, higher concentrations had
excesive absorbance and were hard to set up for the measurement.

Later,
the concentration was also optimalized for the measurements in backscattering
geometry in thermostated cell holder. The 500\,\g{m}L of samples with
75\,\g{m}M, 250\,\g{mM} and 750\,\g{m}M concentrations were used with 5\,mW of
excitation laser power. Only fast decay components were investigated. You can
see the results in
\figref{conc_optim:hairpins}
and
\tabref{conc_optim:lifetimes_hairpins}.

		by the baseline constant $b$ from the fit.}

\begin{table}

	\input{results_and_discussion/assets/concentration_lifetimes_hairpins}

	}
	\label{\tablabel{conc_optim:lifetimes_hairpins}}
\end{table}

The results clearly show that all laser power is not absorbed in the samples
with extremely low concentrations and therefore the lifetime is longer.
Unfortunately also the signal of the sample and lifetime itself are
insufficiently low in this case. We can also see that at least from
250\,\g{m}M concentration the concentration doesn't affect the lifetime
unexpectedly which means that higher concentrations are better up to maximal
practical values which were estimated at 1\,mM for nucleic acids.

For some measurements, it can be also beneficial to measure samples with the
same concentration as in UV absorption measurements so that these two can
complement each other under the same measurement conditions. Therefore the
lower concentrations than 1\,mM were usually chosen in this study.
