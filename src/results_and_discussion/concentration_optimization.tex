\subsection{Concentration optimization}

The next step was to determine the optimal concentration of the measured NA
sample with respect to its photodamage.
First, we tried to estimate the dependence of the lifetime on concentration.
We used the same sample preparation as described in
\cref{subsec:power_optim}
but with variable concentration of samples of 500\,\g{m}M and 1000\,\g{m}M per
nucleobase and 1\,mW of excitation laser power.
We also used the same data treatment as in the previous section.
We could not detect the fast decay component for 500\,\g{m}M samples in this
measurement, so we compared the slow decay components the same way as the
previous section.
The results can be seen in
\figref{conc_optim:triplexes}
and
\tabref{conc_optim:lifetimes_triplexes}.

\end{table}

First of all, it is crucial to notice that there is variation in the
estimated lifetime between this measurement and results from the previous
section (see
\tabref{power_optim:lifetimes_triplexes2}).
The difference between these two measurements was that we used larger slit
width (70 \g{m}m instead of 50 \g{m}m used in the previous section), which
could have an impact on the decay curve because, as we showed in the previous
section, the photodecomposition process is very complex and involves changes in
the sample absorbance which can have a significant impact on the focus because
of the anomalous dispersion.

The second observation is that the lifetime seems to depend almost linearly on
the concentration, proportional to the number of nucleotides in the sample.
This means that in our right angle experimental configuration, all the
excitation laser energy is absorbed in the sample for both concentrations, and
the number of photodecomposed molecules is proportional to the absorbed
energy in this concentration range.
It also implies that the excitation laser power density does not significantly
influence the photodecomposition process in the used range of the laser powers.

This analysis means that samples can endure longer measurements on higher
concentrations.
On the other hand, higher concentrations are also less cost-effective because
they require larger amounts of samples and it is harder to adjust focus for
them.
The spectra are also more influenced by the signal of the sample cell
because the laser beam needs to be focused closer to the cell wall and floor.
1000\,\g{m}M concentration was the highest practical value; higher
concentrations had excessive absorbance and were hard to set up for the measurement.

Later, the concentration was also optimized for the measurements in
backscattering geometry in thermostated cell holder.
The 500\,\g{m}L of samples with 75\,\g{m}M, 250\,\g{m}M and 750\,\g{m}M
concentrations were used with 5\,mW of excitation laser power.
Only fast decay components were investigated.
The results can be seen in
\figref{conc_optim:hairpins}
and
\tabref{conc_optim:lifetimes_hairpins}.

\end{table}

The results clearly show that all laser power is not absorbed in the samples
with extremely low concentrations, and therefore the lifetime is longer.
Unfortunately, also the signal of the sample and lifetime itself are
insufficiently low in this case.
We can also see that the concentration, at least from 250\,\g{m}M, does not
unexpectedly affect the lifetime, which means that higher concentrations are
better up to maximal practical values, estimated to 1\,mM for nucleic acids.

It can also be beneficial for some measurements to measure samples with the
same concentration as in UV absorption measurements so that these two can
complement each other under the same measurement conditions.
Therefore the lower concentrations than 1\,mM were usually chosen in this
study.
