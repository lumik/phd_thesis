\section{Design of UV Raman experiment}

Work on the construction of a new UV Raman spectrometer was an incremental
process. It was necessary to consider the equipment already present in the lab,
mainly the laser system, CCD camera and optical table and specify parameters of
chosen commercial spectrograph. Then the first functional prototype was
constructed and improved for measurement of polarized UV Raman spectra. The
first calibration wavenumber calibration technique of measured Raman spectra
was adopted based on the literature. Then we started to deal with
photo-decomposition of samples by designing a spinning cell which could contain
as small as cca. 20 \g{m}l volumes of samples. After that we widened the range
of usable excitation wavelengths of the instrument and decided to seek for a
new means of wavenumber calibration and after some research and trials and
errors we settled with calibration to the spectra of Pt lamp. And then, the
aparatus was enhanced to enable temperature measurements in backscattering
geometry. Next sections describe each step of the development of the UV Raman
spectrometer in more details.
