	\caption{Top-view schema of the apparatus for multiple excitation wavelengths
		and with side-view inset of the sample space. The right-angle laser
		mirrors optimized for 244-nm excitation were replaced by prisms in total
		reflection mode. M1 was replaced by Pellin-Broca prism PB which separates
		unwanted frequencies from the excitation beam and sends them to the beam
		blocker BB. M2 and M3 were replaced by right angle prisms. The prism MC2 is
		flipped to the position for measurement and calibration lamp is switched
		off. The explanation of rest of the symbols is the same as in
		\figref{wavenumber_calibration:aparatus_schema}.}
