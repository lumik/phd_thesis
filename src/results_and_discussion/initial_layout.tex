\subsection{First layout of the instrument}
\label{first_layout}

At first, we built a proof of concept apparatus to test if we selected the
correct optical elements.
The optical schema is depicted in
\figref{initial_layout:apparatus_schema}.
The laser beam is emitted with horizontal polarization, and we decided that we
want to guide it through a sample in the vertical direction and gather the
scattered light in right-angle geometry.
Because of the steric restrictions in our laboratory, we needed to place the
laser in such a way that it produced a laser beam in the opposite direction
then we gathered the scattered light.
Because of that, we needed to guide the beam in the loop using laser mirrors
enhanced for 244\,nm \emph{M1} and \emph{M2} (Thorlabs) to maintain the right
polarization direction because we wanted to measure not only depolarized Raman
spectra.
The beam was then turned up by another laser mirror enhanced for 244\,nm
\emph{M3} and hit the bottom of the sample cell, having polarization
perpendicular to the direction of scattered signal acquisition.
The excitation beam was focused onto the sample by the plano-convex lens
\emph{L1} with a focal length of 100\,mm.
The most practical place for this lens was between M2 and M3, so we could not
select a shorter focal length as is proposed in
\cref{subsec:focus_optimization}.
The excitation laser beam could be attenuated by
the neutral density filters \emph{ND} with a selection of 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4
optical densities (Thorlabs), which were placed inside the carousel (Thorlabs)
for easy switching.
We also used an old single-blade shutter that we found in our laboratory.
The shutter was controlled from the CCD port for external shutter by the
WinSpec software provided with the detector.
We needed to insert a condenser into the path because the leading edge of the
output signal from CCD was too sharp.
The shutter was open during measurement and closed the rest of the time
to prevent photodecomposition of samples by the UV laser beam.

We needed to visualize the beam for proper laser beam path setup because the
wavelengths in use are outside of the visible light range.
Business cards showed to be the best equipment for beam visualization because
the paper used for them usually has strong fluorescence.
Excitation beam adjustment procedure uses two apertures \emph{A1}, \emph{A2}
and crosshair reticle printed on the paper fixed to the ceiling of the room.
At first, the kinematic holder of mirror M1 is adjusted, so the beam passes
through aperture A1.
If the beam is blocked by some of the other optical elements on its way to the
ceiling reticle, we can use a business card to detect if it passes through the
center of the aperture A1.
Then the mirror M2 is adjusted so that the beam passes through A2, and finally,
the mirror M3 is adjusted to hit the center of the reticle.
The procedure can be iteratively repeated if the result is not satisfactory but
the good alignment was usually achieved after the first iteration.

Raman scattered light is no longer monochromatic, so we decided to use
reflective optics in the light gathering part of the apparatus to avoid
chromatic aberration.
We selected Cassegrain objective \emph{O} (Newport) with $f_o = 13$\,mm
effective front focal length, back focal length in infinity, 0.4 numerical
aperture, and 9.72\,mm diameter of the output beam.
The elastically scattered light is removed by edge filter \emph{EF} (Semrock).
The rest of the collimated signal is then guided by UV enhanced broadband
aluminum mirror \emph{MS1} (Newport) to focusing off-axis parabolic mirror
\emph{MS2} (Newport) with $f_c = 101.6$\,mm effective focal length to the
spectrograph slit.
The spectrograph has f/6.4 aperture, whereas the focusing lens with the
beam diameter determined by objective has aperture $101.6 / 9.72 = f/10.5$,
which means that we slightly underfill the spectrometer's angle of acceptance.
