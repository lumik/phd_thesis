\subsection{Initial layout of the instrument}

\begin{docitemize}
	\item Draw a schema \figref{initial_layout:aparatus_schema}.
	\item Briefly describe used optical elements
\end{docitemize}

		space. A laser beam is emited with horizontal polarization. It is guided
		through carousel with neutral density (ND) filters and by laser mirrors
		M1 -- M3 and laser focusing lens (L1) to the sample cell (S). The scattered
		light is gathered by Cassegrain objective (O) and reflected by the mirror
		MS1 and focused on the entrance slit of spectrograph by parabolic mirror
		MS2. Notch filter (NF) suppresses elastically scattered light.}
