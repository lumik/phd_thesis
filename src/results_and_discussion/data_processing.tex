\section{Development of data processing methods}
\label{data_processing}

High-quality spectra are needed for advanced multivariate statistic methods
used for the measurement analysis.
It is essential to have sufficiently sensitive apparatus which can provide a
reliable signal.
However, raw Raman spectra, which come from the measurement, usually contain
many components, and only one of them belongs to the analyte signal.
The following sections describe the process of transforming the raw spectrum
to the spectrum ready for the advanced result analysis, analysis
of spectra of multicomponent system, minimization algorithm used for the
data analysis, and band intensity estimation overview.
