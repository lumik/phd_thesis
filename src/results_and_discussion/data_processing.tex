\section{Development of data processing methods}

High quality spectra are needed for advanced multivariate statistic methods
used for the measurement analysis.
It is important to have sufficiently sensitive aparatus which can provide
reliable signal.
But raw Raman spectra which come from the measurement contain usually many
components and only one of them belongs to the signal of analyte.
The next sections describe the process of transforming the raw spectrum
to the spectrum which is ready for the advanced result analysis.
