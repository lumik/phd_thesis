\subsection{Low volume artefacts}

The spinning cell can be used not only for measurements in the right angle
geometry but also for measurements in the back-scattering configuration.
We observed the two sharp lines at 1555 and 2329\,\icm{} in these measurements
when very small sample volumes were used.
You can see example spectrum of samples extracted from the alga amphidinium in
\figref{artefact:artefact_amphidinium}.
50\,\g{m}l of sample was measured in spinning cell in back-scattering geometry
with 10\,mW of 257\,nm excitation laser.

\end{figure}

The unknown bands have narrow shape which leads to a hypothesis that they
don't originate from the liquid samples but could come from some outside
source. So the next step was to try to measure the spectrum without the
sample in the sample area. The 120\,mW of excitation laser power was used to
measure high quality spectrum in 10 frames and 120\,s accumulation of each of
them. The resulting spectrum can be seen in
\figref{artefact:artefact}.

The rotational bands around the main Raman bands even narrowed the searching
for the origin of the artefact to some molecular spectrum. Further
investigation and searching through the databases and atlases of Raman spectra
identified the cause of the spectra as molecules of gas \ch{O2} at 1556\,\icm{}
and \ch{N2} at 2330\,\icm{}.

The 50\,\g{m}l of liquid sample rotated at 9600\,rpm results in the layer
thinner than 500\,\g{m}m at the call wall which is much lower than the focal
region defined in
\cref{subsec:focus_optimization}
in
\eqnref{focus_optimization:L_E}
for the excitation laser focusing lens focal length of 100\,mm
\begin{equation*}
L_\text{E} \doteq 11.9\,\text{mm}
\end{equation*}
used in our experiments.
It means that the signal is also gathered from the central cylinder of the air
inside the spinning cell resulting in the contribution of gas \ch{O2} and
\ch{N2} in the spectra.
